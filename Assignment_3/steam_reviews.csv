However, I will say that Deathmatch Classic is a pretty solid arena shooter, even if the gameplay is just like Quake.

The hardest difficulty was painful but I FINALLY DID IT",True,5
50,"This is an excellent expansion. It adds many new features to the game and continues building on the plot in a such a way that skipping it doesn’t hinder your understanding of the next entry.

The platoon mechanic is a neat idea, but a lot of its potential seems to be hindered by scripted events and navigational issues. Very rarely did a soldier follow me for more than a few corridors, let alone entire missions. I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised. After all, the game’s a quarter-century old and was pushing the boundaries of the genre as a whole. Still, it's a little disappointing. In similar respects, the rope is also a cool addition, albeit extremely buggy. The grappling hook is another great addition. I think what I’m most surprised by is the fact that the devs remembered to add segments involving these features all throughout the game.

The expansion does have a few issues, though. The night vision goggles are a cool alternative to the flashlight, but in just about every scenario, you’ll end up turning it on for one short vent system, then turning it off again immediately after. The only time you’ll ever use it for an extended period is during the chapter ‘Foxtrot Uniform’, which is where I feel the expansion starts showing a massive decline in quality. Much like the original game, the last few chapters are very poorly designed. What you’ll find is essentially back-to-back gauntlets consisting of high-level enemies, all of which are severely lacking in ammo and even more so in health. It isn’t fun in any way and I hope whoever was responsible for coming up with the idea was given a stern talking to and forced to undergo a comprehensive shortcourse on level design.

One thing I’m a little curious about is in regards to the Powered Combat Vest. The tutorial showcases four different charging methods for this item, but during the course of the game, I didn’t find any commercial charging stations at all, and was only able to locate one military charging station. Maybe I didn’t look hard enough, maybe they just forgot. Either way, thought it was worth jotting down.

Overall, pretty enjoyable experience. If you liked the original game, you’ll probably like this one, too.",True,4

I can't use my mouse to look around, there's only a few players and the aiming mechanic doesn't make sense but it was still fun to just bounce around and every now and then kill myself.

for a game made in 1998 I LOVED IT! The graphics are charming, The story is interesting, (not directly clear but I love it anyways), The game mechanics are pretty funny, like how Gordon can swing the crowbar at an INHUMAN speed but its great, weapons are incredibly easy to use,
 although my only complaint is how some levels it feels impossible to solve (I had to look at a few walkthroughs) So to complete the game it took me 15 HOURS mainly because of how I got stuck on many parts.

Bosses felt underwhelming (especially without any intense music) I cant lie fighting was fun, and I wish the story telling, either given directly or by enviornmental story telling, was more present. Still loved the game but I recommend that you build patience with it. 
And again for a game made in 1998, It felt pretty nice, turning into a series containing so much lore, world building, and of course  so many unique characters in Half life 2. I can definetly see why people want Half Life 3 to finish the saga.",True,20

100,"Played the entire campaign on stream in one sitting and I have to say, it felt extremely similar to COD and was quite enjoyable in that regard. The voice acting, environments, missions. It all felt very well made. However there is no real story, you're just kind of a misc soldier assuming a role in multiple different militaries like Russia, Germany, Britain, Japan, and the United States. Another thing to watch out for is the fact that the devs made a conceded effort to cram an enemy in any place that will fit one, so make sure to look around every corner and don't be too surprised when you keep getting shot from seemingly nowhere every 5 seconds. Also due to this fact, if you run out of ammo (which you probably will), you better have quick saves on hand or be good with a knife because if you're not, you're SOL.

130,"this really is, half-life: blue shift",True,1
130,"Half Life Blue Shift is about as good as the other Half Life expansions content wise, but it's mandatory for me to say that it's very short. It's probably the shortest Half Life game out of the entire Half Life franchise. 

It took about 2.5 hours for me to beat the main story. To compare, it took 5 hours for me to beat Opposing Forces and about 10 hours for the main Half Life game. It also does not help that this expansion doesn't come with its own PVP/deathmatch mode like the other games I've mentioned.

Despite its length, I recommend it to anyone who enjoyed Half Life 1. I do suggest to play Opposing Forces first before this though.",True,1

The xen parts might i add, are better that HL1's. I kinda wish we got more closure on Dr Rosenburg in HL2. But the damn puzzle where you push the barrel over the wire is fucking BS and i want to strangle the dev that made that puzzle. Overall this game is a fine expansion to the HL1 game collection.

220,"An improvement on the first game in pretty much every way, the only real issue with the first game was the lack of scenario variation as it was all set in one place. However, in Half-Life 2, there is a new location every thirty minutes, which keeps you constantly engaged.

While the weapons are mostly standard compared to the first game, the ones from the first are completely overshadowed by the gravity gun, which is an incredible weapon and a lot of fun to use. This combined with the solid controls, makes this game a blast from start to finish.

The story has become a lot more complex with a number of actual characters, unlike the original game which only had NPCs with three lines, with a few exceptions. Additionally, there is a greater variety of character models, adding to the depth of the game.

The soundtrack is still awesome and really immerses you in the game.

Overall, this is an amazing work that deserves all the praise it gets, I am looking forward to its continuations.",True,5

10/10",True,3
220,"As a long-time fan of the Half-Life franchise, I have to say that Half-Life 2 is an absolute masterpiece. Valve has truly outdone themselves with this game.

First and foremost, the graphics are breathtaking. Even today, years after its release, Half-Life 2 still looks stunning. The attention to detail in the environments and character models is simply astonishing.

But what really makes Half-Life 2 stand out is its gameplay. The game strikes the perfect balance between action and puzzle-solving. Each encounter feels unique, requiring different strategies and weapons to overcome. And the physics-based puzzles are some of the most enjoyable and satisfying challenges I have ever encountered in a game.

The storyline is also top notch. The game's world-building is fantastic, with rich lore and interesting characters that make you care about the fate of the universe. The combination of solid writing and incredible voice acting makes for an immersive experience that keeps you invested in the story from start to finish.

Finally, the game's soundtrack is just incredible. The haunting and atmospheric music perfectly complements the game's tone and helps to create an intense and emotional atmosphere.

Overall, I can't recommend Half-Life 2 highly enough. It's a game that truly deserves its status as a classic, and one that any true gamer should experience.",True,2
220,This game is great I remember playing this game back in 2020 when it was on sale around the time the first one was also on sale. After beating half life 1 and blue shift in 2021 I decided to play the sequel and it is so fun and good. The gameplay is as fun as the original and the new weapons like the pulse rifle and gravity gun are so fun to use. The story is great and my favorite levels were Ravenholm and the Waterboat sections.

If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

6 tablespoons unsalted butter

1/2 cup white sugar

1/2 cup brown sugar

1/4 cup water

1/4 teaspoon cinnamon

1 pinch salt

5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced

1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.

Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.

Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.

Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.

Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

300,"About the game Day of Defeat: Source, I have to say that this game is an absolute classic. It's a first-person shooter set during World War II, and it's just as intense and exciting today as it was when it first came out.

One of the things I love about Day of Defeat: Source is the attention to detail, from the weapons to the maps. The game does a great job of immersing the player in the world of World War II, and it's great fun to explore the different levels and learn the ins and outs of each one.

The gameplay itself is fast-paced and exciting, with a good mix of close combat and long range sniping. The game also rewards teamwork and strategy, so it's always satisfying to work with your teammates to complete objectives and win matches.

Overall, I highly recommend Day of Defeat: Source to anyone who likes classic first-person shooters. It is a timeless game that is just as fun today as it was when it first came out.",True,3

The supporting characters can get in your way and accidentally cause your death, especially when you have to carry the gnome around to get the achievement. The gnome tends to slide around and fall out of the vehicle during a driving section, requiring you to shoot it ahead and then drive to its new location repeatedly. There were also some freezing issues, although not as bad as in the first episode or Black Mesa. The game has a tendency to constantly prompt you with hints, which can be annoying, and it would be nice to have the option to turn them off.

I kindly wish to raise your awareness to people trying to cheat you out of your steam points: The following comment is copy and paste from a lot of reviews on steam.

""I am a 52 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 16. My son recently started Dinkum and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.""",True,12

550,"The principle is simple, but perfectly functional. A team of four cooperates against hordes of infected. Basic zombies aren't dangerous in themselves, but they make up for this handicap with numbers.
Far more dangerous are more capable individuals, who tend to jump on players, throw up, or attract them with their tongue several meters long.

It is in the cooperation of the players that the main strength lies. It pays to stick together and help each other when needed. That includes the situation where your species is rolling on the ground and has a few last moments left before it dies completely. That's when you should rush to the rescue and lift him, at least temporarily, to his feet.
Other types of team solidarity include healing allies or passing out pain pills that temporarily increase health.

As unbelievable as it sounds, in conjunction with the quality game modes, this system has ensured tremendous playability. The first episode already showed it, and the sequel is no exception. The frenetic and sometimes dull action will serve as a great release, and on the other hand, as more serious entertainment. [b] 20% [/b]",True,6

Left 4 Dead 2 – это когда твои соратники убегают далеко вперед, а ты остаешься один на один с Танком. Здоровье на нуле, патроны почти закончились, сложность игры – мастер, плюс не самое подходящее место битвы – вестибюль отеля, но ты каким-то образом все еще жив, в то время как Танк испускает последний вздох. Самое время ликовать, но не тут то было! Слышны душераздирающие крики напарников, которые попали в западню и приходит мрачное осознание, что не только твой подвиг оказался не замечен, но и впору теперь застрелится, из пальца.

Left 4 Dead 2 – это когда возле стоянки автомобилей Жокей седлает одного из твоих напарников, ты бежишь его спасать и одновременно с этим в сторону Жокея летит коктейль Молотова, который не только поджигает все вокруг, включая тебя, но так же и заставляет сработать сигнализации у автомобилей, отчего радостная толпа зомби бежит в вашу сторону.

Left 4 Dead 2 – это когда на одной из оружейных полок лежит гранатомёт, который лично у тебя вызывает некие опасения, а потому ты решаешь проигнорировать это «замечательное оружие». Благо Танк был повержен совсем недавно, а если по пути встретится Ведьма, то с ней можно будет справится собственными силами. Вот только твой напарник считает иначе и берет проклятую «бумкалку». И все бы ничего, ведь зомби умудряются очень весело разлетаться на куски на открытом пространстве, но вот только небольшое закрытое помещение… Ох, эти помещения! Когда удается его миновать вся команда, у которой здоровья осталось хорошо если треть, с «любовью» и «обожанием» посматривают на гранатомётчика и явно мечтают совершить с ним всякие разные непотребства.

Left 4 Dead 2 – это когда трое из четырех выживших находятся в каких-то десятках метрах перед убежищем, а впереди маячит блуждающая Ведьма и ты решаешь пожертвовать собой, благо твое здоровье на нуле, в то время, как напарники чувствуют себя прекрасно. Стреляешь по Ведьме, за что получаешь смачную пощечину, но не умираешь. Утешение слабое, так как перед глазами цвета блекнут и любой, даже самый незначительный удар, может отправить тебя на свидание с сенобитами, отчего начинаешь жаться к бордюрчику и отстреливать самых прытких зомби. И тут, как по заказу, появляется Плевальщица, а у тебя, как назло, закончились патроны в основном оружие. Начинаешь стрелять в нее из пистолета, что мало впечатляет «симпатичную леди». Причем самое обидное даже не это. Самое обидное то, что Плевальщица не обращает на тебя никакого внимания и плюет куда-то в сторону твоих напарников. Ты не обращаешь на это внимание, все-таки у них здоровья было много, а у тебя есть шансы совершить что-то хорошее, пока какой-нибудь особо шустрый зомби тебя не прикончил. И совершаешь. Плевальщица мертва, а ты все еще жив. Удивительно! Самое время посмотреть, как поживают твои напарники. Плохо поживают. Да вообще ужасно. Мало того, что они лежат на земле в луже кислоты, спасибо Плевальщице, так зомби еще пинают напарников ногами. Ну не стыда ни совести у мертяков! А ведь «сейвхаус» тут, в двух шагах. Шестеренки в голове очень быстро срабатывают и понимаешь, что ты – единственная надежда команды. Заворачиваешь за угол и буквально в паре сантиметров от тебя пробегает Громила. Словив детский инфаркт Миокарда, ты дохрамываешь до убежища и закрываешь дверь прямо перед носом у толпы зомби и радостно хихикающего Жокея.

Left 4 Dead 2 – это мультивариативная игра, в которой ни один забег не будет похож на предыдущий. Игра обеспечивала заряд адреналина и хорошего настроения . Игра так и осталась прекрасной мультиплеерной забавой на которую не грех потратить десять, сто, а то и больше часов. Благо вам будет что вспомнить.

The extreme level of different abilities and vast power-spikes can turn a fun and engaging early game experience into a god awful immune to literally everything Slark one-shotting your entire team EVEN if they're fed.

DOTA just simply does not hold up with the level of competitive integrity that other similar titles offer.

The game offers 8 marines to pick from. A pair of each of 4 archetypes. The medic, whos main role is to heal any damage and cure infestations. The Autogunner whos there to push the group forward or to set up supressing fire defending the group. The demolitions marine is best suited to dealing with heavier targets with the use of flamethrowers, mines grenades fire traps and the mean end of a shotgun. Finaly theres the technician for those who want to make the missions easier by welding doors and hacking security and objectives. 

Individual skill is rewarded with all of these archetypes without the loss of sense of benefiting from the teamwork of entire group. 

The setting pays hommage to classic movies and games of the alien franchise yet remains its own kind of alien style with a bit more arcade look. The topdown camera gives a more tactical feel for the gameplay in comparission to first person. Each marine has his own quips and oneliners, and character. 

Since its free i cannot see how you wouldnt recommend it.",True,25

The trust factor matchmaking system completely ruins the experience for new-ish players that will face a cheater 70-80% of the games (even with prime on, and i'm talking about blatant cheaters).
The only way to play the game somewhat normally is to use a third party service, which is quite cumbersome.

1230,"If you like World War 2 first person shooter PVP simulations, this is a free good game to get as a mod of Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45.  This game is more on the realistic side of WW2 combat while still using the Battlefield 2 type of game style. 

You will be using authenically modeled weapons with iron sights. There are no bullet counters, no zoom function, hard to tell friend from foe and have friendly fire.  Has fatigue that limits movement , no healing. Tanks are modeled as close to real thing.  Some classes are Limited in number to a few, while plenty of soldiers with bolt action rifles.  Has artillery strikes called in by a radio located at major bases.
You can play as infantry or tanker only.  

Mare Nostrum is the North Africa, Italy and Crete battles. Has Italian and German vs English and American forces.  Mare Nostrum is a Mod of Red Orchestra, so you need to buy RO.

Needs more people playing and more servers hosted.

1230,"Mare Nostrum is very interesting. It has good maps, visuals, infantry weapons, and tanks. What intrigues me most about this game is that it's a first person shooter set in the African front of WW2. You don't see very many games depicting this aspect of the war in a multiplayer setting. Unfortuanatley the game is dead. Which is sad since the reviews are mostly positive. Even though there is nobody to play multiplayer online I am always drawn back to this game to use ""practice mode"" where you can play against bots, and set their difficulty. On hardest difficulty you get a good challenge, and can play the game by yourself. 

There's not much I can say negative about this game besides dead multiplayer. Awesome free mod.",True,7

The Italians, who at that point were Germany's allies, are covered too. The graphics seem to be decent. The keyboard layout was changed a little from the basic Ost Front layout (they added some more keys).

7.5/10",True,3
1300,"If you're a source engine freak, this is a fun game to pick up when it's on sale. This game adds a whole host of new features compared to base Half Life 2. The audio is satisfying, the soundscapes are quite cinematic-feeling, and the voice acting is good. This goes to show that a studio other than Valve can pull of a total-conversion game for the source engine successfully (unlike postal 3).
Combat with the mutants and in the lab section is really fun. The levels are full of details which makes taking a bit of time to explore fulfilling.
The later parts of the game kicked my ass, but the difficulty wasn't too bad - you really get to see the dynamic difficulty system in action in some parts. In some levels it isn't immediately obvious where to go, but you're hardly ever on a time limit (if at all) so it's not a huge issue. You will die quite a lot when playing for the first time.",True,2

1313,"[u]What I liked about the game[/u]
[list]
[*]	Awesome characters like Blade, J.C and the hot Elexis. Characters like Blade and J.C have a great sense of humour and are always having go at each other. 

[*]	I love how you can interact with things in the environment; it reminded me a lot of Shadow Warrior and Duke Nukem. You can also interact with computers which are heavily involved when solving in-game puzzles.  

[*]	Brilliant soundtrack which fits in well with the cyberpunk and futuristic theme. 

[*]	Drivable vehicles, although they don’t handle very well. 

[*]	Plenty of secrets to find throughout the levels. 

[*]	A great selection of weapons which look futuristic. With one of the weapons you have to find the parts to assemble it, like in Turok.   

[*]	Good level design. One of the levels involves scuba diving. 

[*]	Plenty of blood, guts and gore. You're able to dismember your enemies as well. 

[*]	The game has an awesome training level. 

[u]What I disliked or was disappointed with[/u]

[u]Conclusion[/u] 

A very good game, like I said, good level design, good soundtrack, brilliant characters, and fun combat, which is also challenging. If you like games like Quake, Half-life, Shadow Warrior or Duke Nukem, then I highly recommend you give this game a go.

1610,"It's pretty good.  Space Empires IV has a really simple UI.  The rate of gameplay is quick enough that you can pick up and play in seconds.  The selection of mods is immense, albeit the modding scene appears to be dead.  It's easy to mod things though, so I'm happy.  I might try my hand a making something, but we'll see.  

I used to play space empires V, but the pacing of that game is so much slower, that I really can't go back to it from IV.  Space empires V is a decent game, but the inclusion of 3d makes it so much more cumbersome and painful to play, just because turns are A LOT longer.  In SEIV, turns are wicked quick.  

The size of empires is also very large, relative to most games.   You will have fleets of 10-20 ships early game, which is pretty large for these sorts of games.  In my current campaign, I have two fronts, one where I have about 16 ships split into 4 squadrons, and one where I have a small raiding party guarding the flank.  I assume reaching the point where you have over a 1000 ships is plausible.  We'll see.  

My hours are going to be low on this because I've been playing a modded game through the launcher that doesn't launch through steam.  I don't know how much time I've put into this game, but it's a lot.  Still on my second game, but I don't think my opinions will change.  

Critiques.  The amount of strategic choice in the game is a little bit lacking compared to some games like star ruler.  It's basically do I upgrade shields or weapons, or get new weapons that may or may not obsolete my old weapons.  There's also the problem that comes with random spawns.  I had an empire almost box me in on my second game and take a bunch of what would've been great expansion.  It provided an interesting challenge.  

Modding might be able to solve this.  I've already customized the game to my liking, to allow better early game aggression.  I might come back in a few days and change this around with more insights to different mods, but we'll see.",True,1

1640,"[list][/list] Disciples II is a turn-based strategy game set in the conflict between humans, dwarves, demons and the undead that can either bring or prevent the end of their world.

[list][/list] Unfortunately I’m not recommending this game, but for the curious and to show that it is not all bad in this game, I’ll go first through the good aspects of it.

[list][/list] This game is a prime example of how you can make a very simple set of rules work. It’s a very straightforward strategy game: It doesn’t have overly-complicated upgrade trees with little to no impact for individual improvements; it doesn’t have a hundred types of units and makes half of them useless; it doesn’t have a hundred types of resources that stagger your unit creation.

[list][/list] It’s perfect for a casual quick play, with a really soft learning curve. You don’t have to worry that much about the stats of the units, maybe more about their resistances and type of attack, distribute them properly between the back and the frontline. And that’s it. Of course there are people that prefer more complicated experiences (and at times I like it as well), but again, this game is good if you are looking for some chill entertainment.

[list][/list] The races are quite interesting, each one has a sorta gimmicky approach: Ones are frail but have good healers, others have tough but slow soldiers, ones attack in area and other specialise in single-target destroying moves. But they all have a melee fighter, a ranged unit, a mage, a heavy unit and some sort of extra-gimmicky unit, plus 3 types of hero to lead the units and a couple of utility heroes (that aren’t meant to lead parties).

[list][/list] Each turn you move your parties, fighting against other enemies you come across. And here another point of interest comes into play: It’s quite satisfying to explore the map and fight the NPC enemies: humans, wild beasts, sea monsters, dragons… It’s actually funny how you can send one of your parties down a path or to explore a settlement to find an overpowered dragon that just wipes them out. It adds to the wonder of exploring and the rewards that you can get when the assaults are actually successful. Not only do you get money to build up your city and hire new units, but you may also find one of the many items distributed around the map.

[list][/list] These items tie into my favourite thing in the game: the heroes. As I’ve mentioned, each race has 3 heroes (each one corresponding to an archetype: fighter, ranger, mage) that have to lead all the parties that you control. You create the hero, then add basic units to their party, limited by their level of leadership. All units, basic or heroic, gain experience for every battle they survive and they level up.

[list][/list] When units level up, they evolve into a stronger version of themselves, branching sometimes, depending on which upgrades you choose to buy in the capital. This can be really interesting because it might change around their resistances, the way they attack, the element of their attack and makes you really think which upgrades you will go for first.

[list][/list] When heroes level up, they get to pick upgrades, that go from simply increasing their hitpoints or aiding their party accuracy up to unlocking the usage of powerful artefacts and magic items (the mentioned treasures you find around the map). This allows you just the right amount of customization for your hero and, again, gets a lot done with just a few basic and easy to understand mechanics.

[list][/list] But that isn’t my favourite part about them: It’s the fact that you can keep them around for more than one mission.

[list][/list] During the campaign (and probably for quick missions as well, I focused more on the campaign), if your hero survives to the end of it, you get to keep it, alongside up to 5 items that you’ve found. This is something that really adds a sense of not only tension but a “story” in a way, of a character that survives the whole conflict the campaign is set in and actually goes above and beyond their peers. Yet, at any time, any misstep or unfortunate ambush by the enemy and you may lose a hero you’ve been working on for half of the campaign. It makes you really be careful and throws you sometimes into battle where you HAVE to run away, or risk losing your favourite character.

[list][/list] Last, but not least, the game also has a sorta interesting magic system. Every turn you get to invest some resources into unlocking powerful spells that allow you to summon creatures, buff your parties, refresh their movement points… And each race has a book of 23-25 spells that complement their fighting style.

[list][/list] So… What is so bad about this game that I cannot recommend it?

[list][/list] It’s the fact that, even in terms of old, strategy games, it’s slow. Slow in BOTH aspects: Progress-wise and the technical side.

[list][/list] On one hand, despite the fact that the mechanics and balance play together just fine, the progression in the story doesn’t help them. The campaigns should literally be half their length. It’s interesting to explore the maps, getting the items and wiping out all the enemies. But it’s a shame that only every two missions you unlock the next tier in the units upgrades and the magic upgrades. So you start by being able to upgrade your units only once and having only about 10 spells for two whole missions. And then another two missions with only an extra tier for each unit and new 5 spells. It feels like a drag. The campaign is more interesting than the individual missions (and I guess it usually is for most strategy players) but it really limits the discovery of your race’s strengths. What’s more, this is true for both you and the enemy, so don’t expect to see really cool and strong units on the AI side until you are way down the campaign, basically at the end. Again, if you at least unlocked stuff every mission it wouldn’t be such a drag, but alas.

[list][/list] And it’s a real shame, because all the good that the simplistic design does is basically negated by the fact that progress is slowed down like this.

[list][/list] And yet, I wouldn’t have minded this and would actually have recommended the game if it wasn’t for the other side of the issue, the technical side:

[list][/list] This game is poorly, horribly optimised.

[list][/list] And be warned: You WON’T notice this until you are halfway through one of the campaigns, which would take more than two hours. Don’t risk it.

[list][/list] At the time I’m writing this, I’ve got around a 100h in the game. There are 8 campaigns in the game. I’ve completed one and a half. And it’s not due to the length of the content it’s due to the lengthy processing times whenever the AI is making its move. It’s ridiculous when the AI is making a move you cannot even see because of the fog of war, but the camera pans to their capital anyways and you are basically staring in the void for 5. Bloody. Minutes. Per turn. You have to wait sometimes between 3 and 5 minutes per turn. It can take around 100 turns to explore the whole map in the last missions of the campaign. It takes a whole full-time job shift to complete a map at that point.

[list][/list] This PC runs The Witcher III on ultra, it can actually open Crysis. But here it cannot run the maps. The FPS drop for the larger maps. And it’s even worse when you cast a spell. The effects manage to almost freeze the graphics into a halt. The map size, just like the campaign length, should have been a half of what it is.

[list][/list] So ultimately, this is a great game lost to us due to poor performance. I can’t recommend it because it eventually becomes a drag to play it. It might be cheap, but unless you do something else between turns, I cannot say you will fully enjoy the game. There is probably some game out there that replicates these mechanics way better without the performance issue. Get that game instead.",False,1
1640,"Edit: The game can be too slow without a ""GL wrapper"" that is supposed to decrease turn waiting times.

Definitely try this game. It's like they took Baldur's Gate look & feel with some of the soul of King's Bounty and combined it with some other elements that result in a fun and exciting gameplay. Basically you get to explore and take over cities and resources, creating parties and other specialized units that add interesting mechanics. Each party consists of a leader and whatever units its leadership allows (max 6 units per party). The battles are very simple, just click if you want to attack, defend, or boost but you're supposed to use the overmap mode to bomb the enemies with spells beforehand and buff yourself. It has a lot of interesting mechanics but not incredibly complex, you can understand most of the interface after a few hours.",True,1
1640,"I played Disciples 2 and Rise of the Elves in my teen years. I had so much fun. I did complete all of the campaigns. For me Disciples 2 is the unsung hero of the strategy classics as the crown most of the time is put on Heroes of Might & Magic 3.

1690,"It is really unfortunate that both this game is left unfinished, that Strategy first inc. filed for bancrupcy, that no games have released in around 5 years and that there is no, and probably will never be a succesor title to this game, or even any other game published by them. I have played it, perhaps not too extensively, but enough as to see a lot of interesting concepts that I wish were incorporated into other games. rather than just purely ""oh our stuff is better now"", technology goes up to a level where it makes you shape the galaxy itself. races potentially having afinities to certain tasks such as crystal forging, biomancy or psychic powers, allowing interesting aditions to the play styles without putting them on their heads completey. 

the game, even with the balance mod, suffers from poor balance, AI and especially quality of life. auto exploration as an example barely even works, sometimes breaks and as such you have to do it manually, which becomes a problem as each turn you need to do more and more, cycling through an increasing amount of ships. Temples from religious races either function in a way that only one of each kind works, or one in total per system, which is not completely explained (having an enviromental temple in a system somehow did nothing). regarding balance, since maintenance is based upon the build cost of any given structure and most, if not all structures and ships and everything rely upon minerals, things to increase radioactives or organics production are rarely a good decision while mineral extraction is king. The AI also seemingly doesn't truly know what to do either, so you end up quitting the game mid ways because the game just sort of becomes boring, too micro managey and opaque, with you unable to see why some things are happening the way they do - like, why would this allied weaker faction NOT want more trade with me? they literally only benefit from it!

I probably waste too much time on this review as the game is long dead, but i still just wish it would have been continued. it could be so much more, it is like unrefined ore just sitting here, forever left lying due to misfortune. but if you read this, maybe buy it if it is less than 5 bucks, you might see what could have become something great",False,4

With a little patience, you can make awesome animations and images. If you can imagine it, chances are you can do it in SFM. 

There's a con, though:

Maps and models: not enough. The selection of maps and models are tiny compared to Gmod. On the subject on Gmod, with a little work you can import Gmod models into SFM and they work fairly well when you just focus on posing. Animating, though, is a different story.

Gameplay:
Eurasian Dynasty (ED)
The ED originated from Russia and while they may not be the fastest, they certainly have some of the toughest units in the game featuring heavy tanks, artillery and bombers. They weaponry ranges from conventional weapons to heat rays.
Their basebuilding consists of placing a main 'core' at the center of your base from which you build pipes to connect a variety of structures and generators to power your network of buildings. They can also build walls and a variety of other defenses.
Their ressource gathering is done by mobile refineries which can hover from depot to depot and process all ressources gathered on the spot for a steady income.

Strength: Very tough units, able to turtle quite well using a ring of walls around the mainframe, simple ressource gathering
Weakness: Slow units, buildings are vulnerable to get disconnected from the frame and can get disabled due to lack of power, basebuilding takes up a lot of time and needs to be planned ahead a bit in order to make room for future buildings.


United Civilized States (UCS)
The UCS originated from the United states of america, they have a variety of mechs and jets at their disposal and use a lot of energy based weaponry as well as ballistic missiles.
Their basebuilding is probably the most 'normal' and executed by flying drones that place structures which then build themselves as they drain the ressources needed. Their bases have the unique feature to use add-ons to enhance buildings in a specific way, such as making generators create more power or making refineries generate more income.
Their ressource gathering is rather traditional and has flying harvesters land on top of the ressources, gathering them and returning back to the nearest refinery for dropoff.

Strength: Fairly easy to master, strong missiles backed up by laser weapons, simple basebuilding which doesnt need babysitting. Can place turrets and walls to some extend to provide decent defense. Can teleport freshly trained units.
Weakness: Their structures while efficient can get costy to replace with a bunch of add-ons added to them and expanding to get more ressources does require you to set up additional outposts. Their laser weaponry is prone to get tackled by shields early on which renders them inefficient.


Lunar Corporation (LC)
The LC created orbital colonies and initially settled down on the Moon. They were able to study alien technology and feature the most advanced weaponry out of all the races. Their vehicles are hovertanks, infantry has jetpacks and aircraft are speedy.
Basebuilding for the LC means placing a basic module on the ground and stacking other modules on top to create a tower which depending on modules you places can fill in a variety of roles from research and unit training to combat modules to turn them into tough fortresses. They can also place external turrets and laser walls and all structures can be placed anywhere as they are dropped in from the sky. (you can only call in a limited number of buildings at a time though)
Their ressource gathering is as simple as dropping a mining base next to a ressource field. They will harvest and process it automatically.

Strength: Some of the fastest units in the game, very strong weaponry that is specialized to usually fit a single purpose, probably have the ability to expand in terms of ressources easier than any other race, can build foward or hidden bases anytime, anywhere.
Weakness: Due to their 'stacking' mechanic of modules their structural integrity is often at risk and they are prone to have their buildings get sniped which are even more expensive to replace than fully modded ucs building, their early game units while fast are fairly weak in terms of hp.


Aliens
The aliens are a new addition in Earth 2160 and feature the most unique playstyle using cloning and evolution to create their units and having no ressource gathering in the traditional way.
They can morph strong defensive structures which are able to provide heavy cover for units while they clone and evolve or block off ressource points from your enemies.
Instead of ressource gathering their units absorb a small amount of ressources to evolve into different species, starting with a basic unit that has no way of attacking and a basic mothership you have to clone them to create more and evolve those into different strands to create the perfect army. 

Note: It is advised that you keep at the very least one basic unit to replicate as you might be unable to reproduce if you dont!

Strength: Strong structures, heaviest aircraft in the game, fast and lethal units, can easily poke at hostile bases and harass them.
Weakness: Beyond static turrets no way to defend yourself, take great amounts of planning and macro management to keep track of your units and their evolutions, easy to get harassed and crippled if cloning units are exposed.


Virtual Agents:
Virtual Agents are 'Hero units' which will offer their services for the highest bidder. As Aliens have no means to store ressources they are unable to obtain any. 
Agents pop up every now and then , initially after a few minutes three random ones will pop up and ask if the player wants to hire them. You have to be quick and go for whichever suits you best or simply bid on them all if you feel generous with your ressources. Your enemies also have the chance to obtain them and can make them a better offer. In the end they will join whichever side is willing to spend the most money on them.
Once hired you can spawn the VA anywhere you like and they will remain in your service for a limited amount of time till their contract expires, after which you have to pay them again. If they get killed their contract is also terminated.
Those Virtual agents offer a variety of bonuses for certain playstyles, such as reducing the cost of flying units by 25% or having your ground units start as veterans. The VA's also come in a variety of shapes and often are a powerful unit on their own that if used right can pack quite a punch.
You can have up to 3 agents at a time which will most likely start to chat with one another at some point. This usually leads to quite some hilarious conversations which might entertain you if you like bad puns and sarcastic comments.

Note: Virtual Agents can be disabled during game setup if you dont want to have them around.



Thats about all I can tell ya, if youd like to know more you should just take the game for a spin, especially since its currently on offer for a laughable price. The rts genre usually doesnt bring forth as many games as other genres do currently which is why many of us still play 'older' games to pass the time.

- CGI and all asset/design styles are also from the dark age of people who don't know how to design scifi.
- voice over is cringy to the max.
- limited landscape variety. (very repetitive). 
- extremely limited resources kinda make the whole level and develop your units system irrelevant cos you are forced to rush.

All in all: could have been awesome, if they would have replaced their art director, and taken out the registration system after dumping this game on steam.",False,29
1930,"Super charming old-school open world RPG. Highly recommend it for the freedom of roaming and fun quests. 

PRO 
- Absolutely the best voice acting in all the titles I've played. Dialogue is a bit old-fashioned and full of character. 
- interesting side-quests, really imaginative sometimes
- huge open world map
- lots of weapons, gear, spells, and ability to combine 2+ of same items for powerups! 

CON
- graphic a bit dated now (though still has gorgeous sunsets and water looks great)
- very minor bugs (but do not affect gameplay for most part)
- quest markers sometimes unclear and need to google quest objectives
- horses can't go through teleporters, and run speed is a bit slower than my liking (but if you sheath weapons you can run a bit faster).",True,1
1930,The greatest Oblivion Killer of all time!,True,1
1930,"Pro
- If you like Eurojank then you'll enjoy the combat
- Interesting world to explore
- I enjoyed having to earn the ability to fast travel
- Large variety of enemy types
- The way you upgrade weapons is unique in that if you happen to loot 2 items of the same name, you can click and drag them over one another to combine them and improve their stats

Neutral
- The voice acting ranges from okay to first time doing voice work, but does it's job most of the time
- As opposed to the usual tier of weapons in these types of games (ex. iron < steel < mithril < obsidian < magic metal) it instead has [i] hundreds [/i] of unique - and often named - weapons and armor. So be careful selling things, what may appear to be another metal shield could have the stats of Captain America's shield
- It was likely due to a lack of voice actresses, but the game is an enormous sausage fest, there are almost no female characters in it.


Con
- There isn't much effort put in the way of storytelling, for example: I just finished a quest chasing down someone who has been sabotaging multiple factions and the cutscene just went ""you're a dead man"" and then ended, starting a fight. In other games you would be prompted to return to the people who wanted them dead and they'd give you some fanfare and a reward. But nope, quick fight and he's dead.

- The epic edition made it so that you can't kill the BBEG with a peasant revolt at the beginning of the game anymore

- All melee abilities are practically worthless and a waste of skill points. They have a longer windup than your basic attack and most of them only have an % chance of working. I spent points unlocking a skill only to learn it only had a 13% of working. It's better to just put your points into the passive abilities and magic.

- The one thing that repeatedly takes me out of my immersion is the player character. They range from being rude and aggressive in conversations, to being downright ignorant and stubborn. The biggest example of this is whenever you are in a dialogue regarding the main story: someone will tell you how the world is in danger, and your character will respond along the lines of ""magic and monsters aren't real"" despite him blowing up flesh zombies and golems with fireballs and lightning.

- There is no time passing mechanic, meaning that during the night the majority of shops are closed and you just have to wait for them to open

- Horses are practically unusable on anything other than flat open terrain. They will hard stop on what appear to be invisible barriers. Many times I had it where I wanted to go through two trees that were extremely far apart only for the horse to stop dead in its tracks and start turning around

- With so many named items the upgrade mechanic can become hard to use as you have to find items that match the name of the gear you want to upgrade, so with hundreds of possible drops upgrading your gear can become a big hassle. Which can lead to problems (like I encountered) at the end game where you need better gear but just aren't getting the drops you need. 

- Overall it feels as though the game was rushed and needs a bit more polish. So many missed opportunities for world-building and lore development

Comments with Spoilers
- [spoiler] The main quest ends extremely abruptly. You kill the BBEG and it goes to a cutscene from the beginning of the game as if your sister didn't get kidnapped. Did we time travel? What's going on? Then you ride the horse into the sunset and back to title screen. [/spoiler]

- [spoiler] If you choose the evil path the paladins who have been following you all game appear and replace the BBEG as the final boss. The thing that bothers me is that throughout the entire game you encounter them as ""Stranger""s who give vague comments about how they are watching you. But ultimately they don't do anything for the plot. If you choose the good path they don't even appear to help you with the fight [/spoiler]

- The beginning of the game has much more polish in terms of quests/storytelling compared to the rest of the game. For example [spoiler] the civil war in the starting area needs to be resolved in order for you to aquire one of the macguffins for the Relic. You get to choose which side you support and can work for both factions up until you decide to finish one off. For the rest of the macguffins you just walk into a room and grab it nonchalantly with no real quest related to it. [/spoiler]

- Another example of missed opportunities is [spoiler] you have to get one of the macguffins in a ""White Dragon Nest"". When you get to the nest the artifact is floating in the middle of the nest. You grab the artifact and...nothing. No dragon appears to fight you, in fact nothing appears at all. All this buildup for no payoff [/spoiler]

Tips:
- Despite the combat being janky as all hell, the dodge button is extremely responsive and fluid to use, whereas you need to wind up your weapon, the moment you touch the dodge button your character gets out of the way. This allows you to effectively challenge opponents much higher level than you if you are good at dodging. 

- Everyone in the land seems to be aware there is a Hero lurking about, making it so that almost every single lootable container you come across is locked. Making the lockpick skill absolutely essential if you want to loot the town blind.",True,1
2100,betetr combat than skyrim,True,29
2100,"It's a testament to Dark Messiah's qualities that despite the fairly harsh enemy damage output even on just ""Hard"", extremely stringent skill point distribution, and occasional melee jank, there isn't really another game that has handled an ""action RPG"" that's focused on combat while still offering up genuine RPG character building this well almost 17 years after release. Solid swordplay, ridiculously fun magic and environmental interactions, linear but intricate level design that rewards secret hunting, and a succubus who wants your semen and attention all for herself, what's there to hate?

Much as I can rag on all day about Bethesda strangling Arkane overtime, it's disheartening to know Valve rejected Arkane from making an official Half Life game when Dark Messiah was as good of a resume as they could've shown off in terms of what they were capable of with Source Engine... maybe they'd be in a better place if that happened.",True,24

Just finished the game and it was great fun, it felt like such a breath of fresh air and I can't believe I've never seen this game before. Story is pretty cool, you get to experience the story and hints as the character does.

Combat is good fun, especially because you can knock enemies over, kick them into spikes or off a cliff.
Firebolts and fireballs can be guided, that helps when fighting enemies that will try dodge them.

Exploration is rewarded with loot and cool weapons

The game is dark, but you get dark vision, but you are blinded as soon as you see a light source.

My son found this game at Christmas, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. Loaded into the game world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

There isn't anything quite like this on the market even today and you should check it out if you like action RPGs.

But the game shows it's age as the enemies attack animations and hit boxes are very inconsistent meaning you'll often take damage even though nothing physically touched you. 

The only frustrating bug I encountered was that the game deleted my armour in one of the later chapters making my playthrough significantly harder and longer as I was a melee based build.

2200,"The ultimate arena shooter and one that truly has aged remarkably well. Quake is a weird franchise and the fact that Quake 1 and 2 truly never really connected to each other made the introduction of Quake 3 even more mind boggling. This is basically Quake the Fragalicious Multiverse where you can play the noname Ranger from Quake 1, Doom from, err, Doom and a bunch of Stroggs that took a vacation from being cannon fodder in Quake 2. Add to this a plethora of weird aliens, cyberpunk hoverboarders, space-bikers and Doom’s crush called Crash and you have a weird and varied entourage of strange avatars willing to enter the arena in epic battle that ends in tons of spent ammunition and one player (or players in TDM) on top. 

Q3 took the multiplayer format of the earlier games and distilled it into its raw essence. Pure unbridled mayhem.. Now for sake of argument there is a “single player” in Q3, basically you face off against a bunch of more or less retarded bots in a tiered system until you face the head honcho of the Q3 arenas in a legendary man vs machine playoff. But honestly multiplayer is where this game shines and even today there are plenty of lobbies around for you to drop into for some high-octane rage-inducing railgunning and running. 

It was, is and will probably always be great. My time being good at this game has, however, long since passed..

If you like arena shooters, even a little bit, this is a must-play.

Final Doom is two map packs in one, adding something like 60 levels to your game. It's a surprising amount of content and perfect if you are looking to almost triple your time in Doom II. There is some story, but it's similar to the other classic games in that it's a wall of text every ten levels or so. The maps are pretty well made, with a few exceptions. I definitely recommend it if you were a fan of Doom II and were looking for some additional gameplay.

[h1]Sequel Improvements[/h1]
These two expansions are mostly just map packs so it will run the same enemies and weapons you encountered in Doom II originally. There is double the amount of maps in this installment alone, but nothing new mechanically. 

[h1]Complaints[/h1]
TNT Evilution progressed pretty gracefully, similar to Doom II. Plutonia Experiment, however, was pretty unhinged and starts you off with a significant difficulty on Ultra-violence. Some of the levels are also a bit more confusing, including invisible walls and well hidden switches. 

[h1]Replayability[/h1]
Similar to the other classic Doom titles, your replay value is going to be either raising the difficulty or attempting to get a 100% secret, enemy and pickup score on existing maps. You are most likely playing this to enjoy more Doom II. 

[h1]Technical Issues[/h1]
DOSbox is a pain to setup, and I can easily recommend a source port to play and save you quite a bit of trouble. 

[h1]Value[/h1]
The original Final Doom is no longer available for sale, but you can still purchase either Doom or Doom II and you can download it for free through the in game download page.

2310,"QUAKE by iD Software changed the WORLD when it was released.

The first true 3D FPS game, the first multiplayer client/server FPS game, a soundtrack by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails (I have the special edition of the QUAKE soundtrack by Trent on vinyl), the originator of the WSAD + mouse way of playing computer games (thanks Thresh), it was the origin of the programmable drop-down configuration console which has been used in a lot of other games, and it was the first FPS title with a decent eSports following.

To say that I like QUAKE is an understatement!

I spent YEARS playing this game when it was first released, hoping to compete professionally in eSports and win John Carmack's prized Ferrari. I practised using Reaper Bots daily, memorising pattern runs for all the levels.

Unfortunately I didn't manage to compete in eSports due to the poor internet connections available in the UK at the time, and my parents remaining unconvinced that eSports was a worthwhile focus.

However, I got pretty good. So good in fact, that I destroyed everyone at my high school in an impromptu QUAKE gathering in 1998 or so, which was VERY satisfying.

So therefore, I was very, very pleased when, decades later, iD/Bethesda updated this CLASSIC with a new free update. The new version really does a HUGE amount of justice to the original, and includes SO much new content, bugfixes, and fresh polish.

Now I can play against bots locally like I was in high school now, and even though my reaction times are somewhat less than they were 20 years ago, I am still loving this game. It is a lot of fun.",True,7

As for the gameplay, it's alright for a 90s PC expansion made by a different developer.  The new weapons are a lot of fun to use, but the last few stages can become really tedious having to wittle away at numerous beta class gladiators around every corner that have energy shields and beefed up health.  It's not a problem if you're speedrunning, I guess, but in my opinion they tend to slow normal gameplay down because there are so many of these punching bags to go through near the end of the game; not hard, but somewhat boring.  The standard Strogg guards are now equipped with hyperblasters, ion rippers, and Warhammer 40K style red laser flashlights that are suprisingly accurate and damaging, unlike the 40K Imperial Guardsman's lasgun.  The railgun or rocket launcher makes quick work of them at long range when you get it, though.

Quake II The Reckoning is one of the two Expansion packs for Quake II. There's not much to say, this expansion consist of a fistful of ""hubs"" with different levels each. The gameplay remains unchanged, and the only particular things are a couple monsters and weapons added. The level structure is well done and appropriate and I didn't notice any incongruence or conflict with mission objectives inside the same Hub (as it happened with Ground Zeroes or few times in the original Q2).
This pack is appropriate for those who just want more quake two and don't need any particular revolution in gameplay to enjoy the game.
Since this is an expansion pack it requires the original Quake 2 installed and because of this it presents the same incompatibilities of the original game.

Once inside, you must scour industrial landscapes, crawl through waterways and air ducts, navigate treacherous canyons teeming with vicious mutants, stow away on an alien spacecraft, and destroy the enemy's secret moon base.”[/h1]

The Reckoning Is a expansion pack for the 1997 smash hit Quake 2. The expansion adds a couple of new weapons, ranging from the Ion Ripper which bounces projectiles against walls in a similar fashion as Unreal's Razor Jack and then the always fun to use Phalanx Particle Cannon which shoots dual explosive energy orbs which explode on impact and have a small AOE blast.

Most of the stock enemies had reskins into more powerful variants such as the Gladiator which instead of his normal Rail gun mount, instead now has a triple shot Phalanx Cannon. Another new enemy are the swamp mutants which look like large insectoid primates.

Be warned however if your going to play on Nightmare! difficulty, it definitly will test your skills over the ease of Vanilla Quake 2's nightmare setting.  But if your looking for a challenge you have come to the right place.

2330,"Let's get down to the Nitty Gritty. Quake 2 is, if you've read my other review, my favorite first person shooter of all time. So naturally Xatrix's ""follow up"" to Quake 2 had a lot to live up to. Did it deliver? Well mostly yeah. 

Don't get me wrong though, this is in no way better than the base game. In fact there are many issues that makes this expansion frustrating to play through.

Firstly though, the Units in this expansion are not set up the same way as the base game. In the base game every Unit acted as a central hub with branching levels that you complete to change the hub. (Example is the Power Plant from the base game) this expansion does not do that same structure though. Once you leave an area you are most likely not going to return. As a massive fan of the way Units were handled in the base game this disappointed me. There are moments where the game does this (Unit 3 mostly retains the original style) however most of the time it is linear progression. Don't get me wrong, you can still go back to prior levels, but there is no ingame incentive to do so. 

The levels overall are okay. I found that visually this expansion was much more boring than the base game. In the base game you had caves, a blue tinted security complex, a power plant, and a fancy city (The Palace). All of those look visually different. However here it is mostly the same naturalistic brown and green textures that you start the game with. Although I will say that Unit 4 and Unit 5 are vastly better visually. One thing that got under my skin constantly is the doors. Now this sounds like a silly thing to complain about but, the Base game had this signature knack for having different doors for different areas. The palace had a grand red and gold door, the power plant had a powerful neon red door with a silver metallic finish and the warehouse had square caution doors to help move boxes. In this expansion though sometimes it felt that there was not enough variety in the doors throughout. This again got better in Unit 4 and Unit 5 but for the first four Units you have visually similar doors that feel off model when opening them. Again this sounds dumb, but it's one small issue that helps show the overlaying issue with the expansion's level design. There was nothing really wrong with the level designs themselves (except for one major issue I'll get to later.) And the Strogg Freighter level is absolutely fantastic. 

The new weapons are fun. The Phalanx Particle Cannon is so satisfying to use (although a bit finicky if you're used to the Rocket Launcher) the Ion Ripper isn't bad either, however I found the bounceback features of the projectile to not really come in use do to the bullets seemingly going in random acute directions that do not help you get the upperhand as intended. The Trap is way too rare to find. Throughout my playthrough I found a whopping TWO of them. They are powerful but are too rare to make note of.

Similarly the new power up, Dual Fire Damage, is great. It is the polar opposite of what Quad damage does. Instead of multiplying your damage output it instead doubles your firing rate which makes easy meat out of some of the new enemies. 

The new enemies are a mixed bag. Every enemy has it's problems that makes them either a chore to fight or underutilized. The best new enemy is the Gekk, similar to the Mutant in Quake 2 this enemy is a ""natural animal"" of the Stroggos planet. Its Gibs glow yellow which is a really neat effect. The Laser Guard, which shoots a constant laser that WILL hit you no matter what you do is frustratingly unfair and made me want to just quit the game on multiple occasions. The Repair bot is pointless, I forgot it even was an enemy until I was writing this review. It is similar to the Flyer enemy, except it's black. It's not that they are necessarily bad ideas for enemies, it's the fact that they are placed extremely sloppily in the levels. For example the aforementioned Laser Guard is a literal hitscan enemy whose  laser gets you instantly on sight. The bigger issues about this is that the enemy is usually placed in far away ledges or very odd angles (See Unit 4 and Unit 5 for your share of unfair Laser Guards) The Beta Class Gladiator has way too much health for how many of them appear in the game and I found myself desperately running around them as to not waste ammo. Don't get me started on the final boss. It is a lazy recycle that has no lore backing up why it happens. I know Quake is not a very story heavy game. But it's like if Roman from Uncharted 1 suddenly came back in Uncharted 3. It makes no sense and really takes you out of the game. It's not like the boss was much harder anyway, the Beta Class Gladiators are much more difficult than the boss which makes it even that much more pointless. 

So, Quake 2's first Official Mission Pack, how is it? It was okay. There are things I loved (The Strogg Freighter level for example) and things I COULD NOT STAND (Laser Guard) I'd say atleast give it a crack to see if you enjoy it. I know others prefer this over Ground Zero, but I still prefer Ground Zero as its levels are more varied visually and it is overall a much more interesting and fair (to me atleast) expansion pack.

I never got to play the mission packs as much growing up so each time I do a playthrough of Quake 2 there are still things that I forget when doing the Mission Packs. When comparing The Reckoning with the base game (Quake 2) the design is sub-par. Yeah, the extra levels, different enemies (I do like that the enemies are more challenging), and the extra weapons are enjoyable it just doesn't give me the thrill I get when playing the base game. The level design is pretty repetitive where in the base game there is a bit of variety when progressing through the game that keeps things fresh. I found some of the enemy placements to be too predictable, especially when I don't even remember the mission packs as much I can easily figure out that there is going to be some enemies behind me as soon as I progress to a certain point in the level. It just gets boring a little more than halfway in. 

If you loved Quake 2 like I do then I do recommend this The Reckoning Mission Pack purely for the extra content and challenge but it is definitely not a necessity and quite forgettable.

2340,"If you've ever played user-created levels for a game, you know there are huge gulfs in quality between them. One level might look as good as the real deal, and the next might look like a teenager gave up halfway through making their school. Coming off of Quake II and The Reckoning, Ground Zero is a real shock to the system, not in how it looks but in how it plays. And there's no amount of polish that can make up for how low its lows are.

Turns out that every chapter in the Quake II story starts the same way, with your hard-assed marine's drop-pod getting clipped by something and ending up where it shouldn't. This time you get ditched into an underground mining facility, which you'll need to escape to take out a gravity well generator that has the human fleet trapped over the Strogg homeworld. Just like the rest of the series, this means battling through units of interconnected levels to accomplish goals and proceed to more important locales.

Ground Zero starts promising enough, with colorful, atmospheric caverns and mining complexes. There are exploding crystals you can shoot, mine carts to ride, and excavators to Kool-Aid Man through walls. The pack vomits guns at you almost immediately, setting you up with half the arsenal not two levels in. Your foes are varied and scattered, with an unusually heavy emphasis on fliers of all kinds. All the elements are there for a different, interesting Quaking experience.

Then you reach a point where you've killed everything on the sizable level and don't know where to go. Maps in Ground Zero use a lot of loops and alternate paths without clear landmarks, making it hard to tell if you've even been somewhere before if there aren't bodies littering the floor. There's very little logic to the layouts of each area, with most designed first to slow your progress with meandering paths and second to provide an adequate challenge. The F1 mission objectives do nothing to help either, giving only vague orders to proceed to a new map or defeat all resistance.

By the time you reach the Tectonic Stabilizer you'll have spent a good bit of time wandering aimlessly through depopulated levels. It is here that you will be tasked to destroy sixteen small capacitor-looking things mounted on walls around the map. Sixteen. Afterwards, you must flip three switches, which triggers a 45-second countdown to escape the map. If you fail, you die. This all takes place on a dark cave map with multiple loops and crossing paths and indistinct chambers.

I was not kidding earlier, it is legitimately shocking how painful some of the levels in Ground Zero are. The Stabilizer isn't the only one with instant deaths, either. To even reach it, you'll have to brave a number of cave-ins in the proceeding levels that can crush you dead in an instant. Every single thing you do requires scrambling around winding paths to push a button that lets you get a key that opens a door to another path, and most of the time the goal is just to get to the next map.

Don't expect the new enemies or weapons to redeem this, either. There's a neat ceiling-crawling spider foe but the other additions are reskins with obnoxious gimmicks and fucking ceiling turrets. The new rifle and mines feel very low-impact and situational compared to the base arsenal, and ammo for the expansion gear is far more prevalent than regular ammo, forcing you to make them work over keeping to your standbys. Weapon moderation is part of the challenge here, but the real challenge is sticking out the annoyances introduced.

Honestly, I couldn't get more than halfway into this one. Ground Zero is aggressively bad. It will go out of its way to waste your time with overly twisting levels, tedious backtracking, and instant death out of nowhere. The new enemies and weapons bring nothing to the table, and even the story is so much thinner than that of its predecessors. Fans of Quake II, I implore you, finish the base game and The Reckoning and then seek out community maps if you must. This just isn't worth the hassle.

The gameplay remains unchanged, and the only particular things are a couple monsters and weapons added. The level structure here looks flawed to me as I've run into a couple of incongruence or conflict with mission objectives inside the same Hub (for example go to a level to grab a disc, change level to modify the disc, take it again and go to the previous level again... But once you get there the doors are locked. Ok, let's get back again, there will be another exit... the objective says to modify the disc again... really? Ok, let's do it. Let's find another way and grab that blue key, I might want to look past that blue door... Objective has changed asking me to walk back the same path it asked me two levels back?).
This pack is appropriate for those who just want more quake two and don't need any particular revolution in gameplay to enjoy the game and most importantly have the patience to deal with possible objective paradoxes.
Since this is an expansion pack it requires the original Quake 2 installed and because of this it presents the same incompatibilities of the original game.

I don't recommend this expansion pack because even I didn't enjoy at all the Objective paradoxes, that's an issue given by bad level design. I give 6/10 anyways because someone might still enjoy the extra actions and maps.

[h1]Take out the Big Gun sounded simple enough, except the Strogg were waiting. You, and a few marines like you, are the lucky ones. You've made it down in one piece and are still able to contact the fleet. The Gravity Well, the Strogg's newest weapon in its arsenal against mankind, is operational. With the fleet around Stroggo's, 5% of ground forces surviving, and that number dwindling by the second, your orders have changed: free your comrades. Destroy the Gravity Well.[/h1]

Quake 2 Ground Zero is a expansion pack for the 1997 Smash hit Quake 2. The expansion pack adds new bosses, weapons and new Stroggo's to slaughter. The new weapons leave something to be desired. For example the ETF Rifle which is basically a clone of the first Quake's nail gun is mediocore at best, especially on the high difficulties. Poor bullet velocity but average damage. The Proximity grenade launcher is pretty much exactly the same as the normal grenade launcher but attaches grenades to walls which explode if you or a enemy comes close, The rest of the other weapons arent worth mentioning.

The new enemies in general are fun to dispatch and not to difficult even on Nightmare difficulty. However a new enemy was introduced namely ""Wall Turrets"" which are little security guns which fire as soon as they see you, And worst of all the wonderful map designers though it would be great to put these in the crappiest places you almost never look at. I lost count of how many times i would enter a door way only to get shot in the back of the head due to a turret mounted directly above the door frame. This was probably my biggest gripe with this game.

Then come the bosses. Oh God the bosses.... If your playing on nightmare difficulty you will learn a lesson in sheer frustration.  My only word of advice is ensure you use ammo sparingly at all times and save up all the Cell packs you can.

2340,"Short version: avoid this and play the infinitely-superior Reckoning instead. Long version: Rogue apparently thought they were still making Strife, which means that a Q2 mission pack somehow features confusing and maze-like maps with terrible backtracking elements. The new weapons range from passable to useless, with the reskinned splash-damaging nailgun being the best, and the chainfist being the worst, since you're required to get up-close to the average Q2 enemy to use it, universally-known as a terrible idea

And to complain about both, the level design severely-limits how you can effectively-use the rocket and grenade launcher, two things a Quake game should never have an issue accommodating by design. The cramped and compacted rooms and corridors make using both either suicidal or a total waste of ammo, as enemies will either be on hard-to-hit ledges, blocked by walls/poles/architecture, or too close to where you bathe in the splash damage yourself 

And then the ENEMIES, every new enemy is a horrible pain to deal with, and not in the fun strategy-deducing way, but the projectiles-that-might-as-well-be-hitscan way, I'm looking at YOU, plasma-shooting spider-thing. The worst addition however is the fact that there are autotracking sentry turrets EVERYWHERE, you generally can't go a minute or two without running-into one, and they hurt, a LOT. They take forever to destroy due to the fact you have to be constantly-moving in order to avoid either their painful blaster shot, or usually-instagibbing rocket shot, and they have an ungodly amount of health for a fixture, so better make sure you actually hit them",False,17
2340,"Quake 2: Ground Zero is the third part of the ""Quake 2"" Saga which began with 1997's masterpiece, Quake 2, and was continued with the frustratingly inconsistent Quake 2: The Reckoning. Finally in August 1998 the third and final official installment was released... and from what I read most people find this to be ""by far"" the worst of the three... but I actually find this to be much better than The Reckoning and comes close to be of similar quality to the base game it expands upon.

The level design itself is, for the most part, excellent. It is compact, expansive, and uses the same hub structure that I found made the base game so successful and unique. Unlike The Reckoning, which was filled with long hallways and an almost obnoxiously linear structure (not to mention AWFUL enemy placement) Ground Zero feels, mostly, fair and interesting. One of the earliest levels of the game you are running through a mine while you have to exit the collapsing mine within 45 seconds. It is a adrenaline pumping sequence that tests your speed. And from there you are given two choices, take a newly opened pipe or exit the way you came. Depending on which choice you take you either get a secret extra level (which is my favorite level of the game) or you return to the beginning. Its little parts like that, that makes the game feel alive. Besides that one sequence there are segments later where you literally see a pod come crashing down creating a path through a level, and the aforementioned secret level where you are being chased by lava and you must make your way out. It spices up the level design seen in the base game in a lovably ambitious way. It feels like something from the base game while having its own flair. 

The new enemies are pretty good. Of course I have to begin with the elephant in the room, the turrets that are scattered through the game. I find them, mostly, completely reasonable. Don't get me wrong, they aren't great.. and in fact they do intrude a bit too much... however compared to the unfair Laser Guards and overly defensive Iron Gladiators from the prior expansion they are an improvement. This expansion also has a spider type enemy, whose special attack (besides climbing on the ceiling) is playing dead. It honestly caught me off guard a few times and made me stay on my toes and be sure to gib those enemies before they get back up. This expansion also puts good use to the Medic enemy from Quake 2. An enemy who appeared so little in the base game I didn't know its ability for almost a decade after I first finished the game. In this expansion he appears multiple times and even has an upgrade which, while difficult, is certainly a fun foe to fight. 

The final boss, without spoiling too much, is an improvement on difficulty (or lack therefore of) from the base game (as in you have to actually try to kill it) and is a MASSIVE improvement from The Recogning's blatant lazy recycled content. With its own cool attacks and a fair challenge, the new final boss in this expansion honesty is a fitting end to the official Quake 2 trio (of course there is Zearo, the 4th part... but thats for a different day) 

Quake 2: Ground Zero may not live up to the base game 100%, however I feel as an expansion it far surpasses the Recogogning in both variety, level design, and originality. As someone who needs to get his Quake 2 fix I highly recommend it.",True,12
2340,"Ground Zero is an astonishingly awful expansion for Quake 2. Ground Zero fundamentally misunderstands every single last aspect of Quake 2's original design. It has bad level design, poor pacing, boring environments (even moreso than the original quake 2!), terrible enemy balancing and placement, and a general lack of interesting new additions.

The new weapons are not very interesting. The most worthwhile additions are the mines and the proximity bomb launcher (which is just a reskinned grenade launcher), which are still pretty boring and can be niche. The nailgun from Quake 1 is back, but it is far less powerful and is nowhere near as satisfying to use. A lot of the new weapons are not bound to keys on your keyboard, so you have to cycle through your inventory in order to use them.

The level design is possibly the biggest deal-breaker here. Levels are even more corridor-heavy than in base Quake 2, and environments are hardly mixed up in the slightest. Enemies that are so powerful that they counteract nearly your entire arsenal are placed around corners with no way to see them coming. Crossing a corner without the right weapon equipped (typically the minigun or the railgun) will often force you to reload a save. Secrets are rare and almost never contain worthwhile items, making them far less interesting and worthwhile than usual. Visually, the game is rather boring and uninspired, with the most interesting visuals and ideas being in the mines at the beginning of the expansion.

The terrible level design goes hand-in-hand with the terrible enemy design. While most of the enemies from base Quake 2 are fine here, the new enemies are some of the worst I've ever seen. The worst offenders are the turrets, which do an insane amount of damage (piercing armor, too!) and are placed in incredibly cruel places. What this means is that the game devolves from a movement shooter to a ""tactical"" shooter, where you need to slow to a halt to check your corners whenever you enter a room (because if not, you're guaranteed to lose most of your health in one shot!). The other awful offender is the new medic enemy, which summons hitscanners (potentially higher tier ones!) so ridiculously fast that you generally won't be able to kill it without the minigun or wasting a ton of resources. A lot of the other new enemies are less offensive, but they're typically extremely tanky reskins of enemies from base Quake 2, so they're very boring.

Please don't play this! It is absolutely painful. I like Quake 2 more than most, and this expansion simply doesn't get what made the game enjoyable in the first place. Running and gunning not being viable in a Quake campaign is utterly sinful.

2390,"[h1] Retro Review[/h1] 
Heretic is a game I absolutely never heard of due to being completely overshadowed by Doom and its Heretics sequel, Hexen. That is popularity wise as its rarely spoken about. I don’t see much why as the game is pretty neat and an overall improvement in the whole Doom esque first person shooter formula.

[u] Gameplay[/u] 
As usual you spawn in a map that has various enemies to beat, items to pick up and secrets and keys to find. Map design wise there were some occasional moments where I got stuck that made me find a guide, but overall it didn’t happen that often. No map gets ever as atrocious as that one secret punch puzzle or the city in Doom 2. 

I really dig the unique weapon design and each of them functions completely different. The first weapon you get is a crossbow that randomly shoots three enchanted arrows and which explode. You will have in total 6 unique weapons and additionally two melee weapons. I really like how all of them, aside the melee and starter elven staff, were useful from start to finish. Especially when using a power up tome.

There are power ups and various items in your inventory that help you and give you a lot more freedom. Not only are there simple items like health potions but also more interestening stuff like an item that lets you fly or a power up tome that not just increases a weapons damage but also entirely adds a new effect. The crossbow now rapid fires multiple arrows, or the rocket launcher staff becomes a high damaging flamethrower, the firemace shoots instead of small musket bullets now slow moving, very large cannonballs. Awesome stuff! Sadly you don’t see it that often as they don’t give you those tomes very often.

Pacing wise its great excluding the DLC. The first chapters each have an unique boss fight culmulating into the final confrontation on one of the serpent riders. The next two DLC chapters basically spam a lot of bosses from the previous one. Also since nothing new aside some wall sprites got introduced in it I felt like the game was fine ending with 4 chapters.

Game drops as usual not as a port but rather lazy via an DOSbox script. Just download gzdoom, extract the contents into the games folder, delete dosbox and rename gzdoom dosbox. This will make the game launch perfectly through steam.

[u]Story [/u] 
Basically 4 serpent riders took over the worlds religion, main character is part of the elven race and decides to fight back, not worshipping thus being branded a heretic. Turns out the serpent riders call forth monsters from another plane and it basically is a copy paste story, even the writing, from Doom.

[u]Aesthetics [/u] 
I really like the games colour palette as it has very bright and vivid colours at times but also is not afraid to go in very dark territory. Wide mixture of different sprites, colours, maps and designs. I especially like the staff designs, even the main character. Its the first time we ever see a hairy, swole dude from the elven race portrait as a manly demon and monster slayer. The music was really neat but not as memorable unlike the very impressive and loud weapons sounds. Especially the crossbows launching followed by an explosion sound or the rapid firing electric burst sounds of the dragon claw.

[u]Conclusion/TL;DR [/u] 
Definitely recommending this game, fast paced action gameplay you know from Doom except added some spice via various items and power ups. I really like the games aesthetic coupled with its good gunplay. Give this game a go if you like these types of games as its a well refined shooter experience.",True,2

2400,"( full review with screenshots: https://www.gaming-parrot.com/2023/02/the-ship-review-murder-on-high-seas.html )

The Ship is a multiplayer game from 2006 that, in its primary mode, drops players on a large ship and tasks each of them with hunting down a specific different player. Everyone in the game (except, optionally, a handful of ""passenger"" players) has a target and is someone else's target, but all you know at the beginning of the game is who you are and the name of your target, but not what the target looks like or which player they are. You also don't start with any weapons, so you'll need to scrounge around the ship to find things like blunderbusses and golf clubs that have conveniently been left in drawers and suitcases. If you can find and kill your target, you get a reward based on how rarely your weapon has been used. You're also allowed to kill your hunter if you can identify them, but if you get paranoid and kill someone else accidentally, you'll be penalized. 

The idea of playing The Most Dangerous Game many times over on a giant ship is appealing enough on its own, but The Ship's real appeal comes from all the little systems it adds on to this core idea. There are cameras and NPCs all throughout the ship who can report you if you're caught with a weapon or behaving aggressively in the wrong place, so you'll often have to carefully tail your target until they leave a protected area without being so obvious that they realize what you're doing. On the other hand, since there are a bunch of player ""needs"" like hunger, boredom, and bladder, you also can't just hang out in the safe areas forever to avoid being killed. Eventually, you'll have to take a risk and go find something to drink. 

The maps themselves also have loads of secrets to add to the game. There are hidden passages to help you get between areas quickly, little alcoves you can hide in to make yourself hard to catch, and even secret weapons. One map has lifeboats you can drop on to unsuspecting rivals, and another has a poison needle you can use to sneakily kill your target without anyone realizing you were even involved. You'll have time to play quite a few rounds on one map with the default timers, but it doesn't get stale since you're developing a better understanding of the map as the round goes on. 

Of course, the elephant in the room is that the game servers went down years ago and the fan servers that are still available are both somewhat hard to find and generally empty. This is a game that's only really playable if you can organize a group of friends or join a game group to find other players, which can be a fairly major barrier to getting a game going. That said, it's also the kind of game that I think you'd primarily want to play in those groups anyway. It's much more fun to be hunting and accidentally killing your friends while in a Discord call than it is to do be doing the same to randos over in-game text chat. Playing in a group also helps keep everyone's knowledge of the map roughly the same. 

Other than the dead servers, the only things I particularly dislike about The Ship are some QoL issues that you probably wouldn't see if this wasn't a 16 year old game. Accessing the map is slow and unintuitive, and it's not terribly easy to read even when you get there. Inventory management is clunky and clicks can be slow to register, and for some reason you can only register four weapons to hotkeys. Having everything on a weapon wheel would have been much smoother to use in a fight. Beyond that, it sometimes feels like NPC and camera vision cones are bugged and you can be in or out of sight when it doesn't seem like you should be. There's a handy indicator that tells you when there will or won't be witnesses, but that doesn't help you fix the issue when you're being watched and it already feels like you're out of sight.

2520,"Gumboy - Crazy Adventures earns my first negative review. 

[b]Campaign:[/b]
Let's get started, the protagonist known as Gumboy is a ball (most likely made of gum) that can transform into different shapes by collecting different in game items. There are different story sections of the game: Tutorial, Magic Forest, Bean World, Summer Meadow, Underground, and Caves. Each section is about equal in length except Underground which only has three levels. The tutorials offer a system which allows you to learn the basics of the game before they infuriate you in the actual campaign. Each mission you  have an Astral Guardian who will help you to achieve an objective. Once you have completed the requirements a pollinator (somewhere on the map) will release pollen, you must then using an item offered by the Astral Guardian push the pollen back to the Astral Guardian. Upon completing this a portal opens which you can roll, roll, or roll into. This ends the level and allows you to move up to the next challenge. You can start in the first level of Magic Forest, Bean World, or Summer Meadows meaning there is no real beginning to the game. In fact there is no real story, just simply roll and collect the dust then roll on your merry way. 

[b]Gameplay:[/b]
If you didn’t notice I used the word roll a lot, this is because roll is your only native control. In order to jump you must collect a hiccup seed and it only lasts for a set amount of time. This is fantastic the character can essentially only roll left to right prior to collecting an item, this means before starting a level half the time you have to roll and find this item so you can actually start the level. Not only do you need to find the ability to jump before starting a level, you must then go find the shape transformation items on the levels (this is not optional). You play a character who is made of gum and cannot mold itself or jump by itself. The game continues by making it so the terrain has random bumps in it that block you from effectively moving (half the time throwing me in the wrong way – over and over again). The jump ability only works half of the time and the heights obtained by the jump seem completely random so going from one platform to the other is essentially just luck of the draw. If you could get past the incredibly poor controls, the required transformation changes, the ridiculous requiring an item to jump concept, and the awfully designed terrain you'd still probably not like this game. Gumboy - Crazy Adventures still pushes the boundary with an awful menu interface, rather than being able to simply move the mouse and select to exit a menu you need to roll your character through each menu option where it requires you to stop and wait till the sub menu interface opens. Even the in-game menu works similarly; to exit you have to roll round a huge ball just so you can quit the game. Gumboy – Crazy Adventures is a game that offers very little in the sense of entertainment. Then this game strives for being least interesting game by offering poor controls, terrible terrain navigation, and illogical gameplay.

[b]Result:[/b]
Overall I would not recommend this game, although seeing as it came with the Indie Puzzle Back I guess you'll just have to have it stuck in your library. Some people would say you could get past all these deficits because the ambience is nice, the environment is pleasing, and the music is soothing. If you want a puzzle game where you are a ball, that offers interesting music, beautiful scenery, and a serene ambiance play influx. It’s the same price, it was made in 2013, and you will not want to kill yourself every time you try and move the character. 

Pros:
+Whimsical music.
+I personally like how the dialogue is gibberish. 

Cons:
-Poor Controls
-Poor terrain set up
-No default jump command ""must find a Hiccup Seed""
-Poor menu interface/navigation
-Requirement to change shapes in order to beat levels (rather than allowing the gamer to decide when to change shape)
-Jump ability only works half of the time once you get the hiccup seed
-Jump ability heights are almost completely random and do not couple with speed boost
-Ball will bounce randomly around terrain rather than move effectively in one direction or another",False,72
2520,"I must say I am quite surprised by so many negative reviews. To me this little game is pure genius. There's something about it you just can't put your finger on... something strange, hard to define.

""Here's something completely new, it's there, who cares"". The mechanics and physics are spot on and the game explores them brilliantly. Visually it's beautiful and the characters you interact with are strange and fascinating. A feeling of novelty and discovery permeates the game from start to finish.

Decent games, but with one major flaw: terrible level design.

All the 3 games have some incredibly bad choices for level design in certain levels, to the point that the game can become unplayable at times or require a very specific build or strategy to get through.

The RIP Trilogy, obviously exists of three games:
-RIP
-RIP2:Strike Back
-RIP3:The Last Hero

All three games are pretty much the same; Kill all spawning enemies, Pick up powerups/weapons and level up. The only real difference I can come up with would be the fact you controll a stationary base cannon in RIP(1), whereas in the other two games you'll be able to walk around and in later in the game, you will be able to controll vehicles.

Gameplay is standard but fun and quite addictive. You could compare it to 'Crimsonland' which, most likely took this game as an example. The weird thing though, while many people rate Crimsonland positively, I do not get the negative ratings about this trilogy. It's obvious a lot more work has been involved in the RIP-Trilogy compared to Crimsonland, just look at the screenshots.

2600,"I can't believe I haven't left a review for this game yet.

This game is by far my favourite game of all time. When I first played it, it transported me to this amazing world of escapism, where vampires walk among us and are playing their own game of political chess without anyone knowing and you're the newest pawn.

The art direction holds up really well, there's a lot of classic gothic influences as well as real-life locations in LA influencing the environments. The night clubs are all exceptional, Nu-metal and gothic fashion was at its peak in mainstream media and the clubs reflect this, one of which is an old church with bright red lighting, dancers in hanging cages and Ministry blasting in the background. Fucking awesome.

The music is incredible, Rik Schaffer's soundtrack ranges from ambient pieces with broken ringing pianos akin to old classic horror compositions, to these super gothic trip-hop tracks that evoke Massive Attack and Portishead, to some really rich melancholic post-rock pieces that pierce through the atmosphere and stay with you for years.

And the writing is the real shit you can sink your teeth into. To preface, there is a lot of dialogue of its time, with a lot of edgy satire poking fun at pop culture at the time, as was common in other games games like the GTA series, but at this point I find it charming, despite how some of it might have aged. The characters have a lot of depth and personality, they all have their own goals and things that make them tick, some of which might be well hidden by diplomacy, aggression or even flirty behaviour, but each character has all of these things and it makes you want to discover what their end goal is. Your choices really affect your alliances and relationships and each playthrough still manages to offer new paths after multiple playthroughs. It's incredibly satisfying.

The gameplay is a mixed bag, the RPG elements are great, taking inspiration from the tabletop game, there's a lot of variety in each clan and their abilities. You can get some really unique builds and variety in the gameplay, whether it be through stealth, melee weapons, guns or purely pacifist means, you can get from A to B in 10 different ways. However, it's important to note that in the latter half of the game Troika had a lot of pressure from Activision and eventually went under after being rushed to release, so it does become a lot more combat oriented and doesn't hold up as well as the rest of the game. That said, it's not enough to drag down the rest of the game. There's simply too much good shit for some bad combat sections to ruin the experience.

So yeah, I'd recommend this game lol",True,12

[h1]The gist of it:[/h1]
Every time someone mentions Bloodlines you'll want to replay it and so I did, along with the unofficial patch, but more on that later. Vampire The Masquerade Bloodlines is quite a classic action RPG, with a lot of ups and a lot of downs but with a consistently great atmosphere. 

👍 [u]The good parts:[/u]
+Incredible atmosphere
+Sexy soundtrack
+Pretty good story

👎[u]The bad parts:[/u]
-Even with the unofficial patch, it's a huge buggy mess
-Poor and janky combat

[h1]Story[/h1]
Bloodline is without a doubt a very underrated game in regards to its main and side stories. Even to this day, I enjoyed it so you can imagine what some of us felt almost 20 years ago when it launched. 

The game starts pretty chaotically, you become a vampire, illegally, and you are sentenced to death. However, that is shortly interrupted by the Brujah vampire gang leader which is in opposite of the way the prince of LA does things and thus you get spared and are employed automatically by the said Prince LaCroix to do his bidding. 

After a brief tutorial, you arrive at your place in Santa Monica where your whole story begins. It's a huge political plot full of war and mystery between the vampire clans and you are in the middle of them all. How you choose to deal with it, who to trust, and who to help is up to you, and that is where the beauty of Bloodlines is found. You'll meet a lot of interesting vampire leaders, interesting humans as well, and some not so much, but everything is well crafted to present you a gripping dark story of vampires which we never actually saw in video games. 

That's what makes Bloodlines special despite its many flaws. The choices you make will have consequences so be certain of what you pick or whom to help when the time comes. There is no pure good in the land of vampires. Remember that. 

Story rating: 8/10

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
This is where the bad parts of the game are found and which turned off a lot of people from it. Bloodlines is a mix of first-person shooter and third-person melee depending on how you play. It's also an RPG in which you can create your own character by picking the vampire clan you wish to be as well as putting points in your character stats. 

The RPG aspect is decent, you have a ton of things to develop, such as lockpicking or hacking as well as upgrading your specific clan skills which are unique for all clans with the exception of 2-3 basic skills. Sadly nothing is made equal and a lot of stats will become rather useless toward the mid-end game. My advice is to just focus on something rather than spending it all around and always go for lockpicking. It's a mandatory stat to increase in my honest opinion. 

The other aspect is the dialogue which I'll talk about briefly. There are certain characters and story aspects where picking the right dialogue choices may have pretty different outcomes. The game never tells you this, but there's a hidden karma system or something like that for some of the characters. Ultimately the main story won't change much and you'll still have several options at the end regardless of what you did with some of the more...unique individuals. 

The final and worse part of the game is the combat. There's no nice way to say this but it's utter sht. Wanna play melee? Enjoy watching and missing and hitting enemies in the jankiest way possible. Wanna shoot things? Good luck aiming because it's bad as hell. There is nothing about combat that works well. It all boils down to using your clan skills, if they are overpowered, you just spam those, or you resort to cheesing your way most of the encounters. You could potentially stealth, as that is also an option but it's the worse stealth mechanics ever made. If your clan does not have any stealth-related spells, no matter how many points you have in sneaking, it's a coin toss because of the AI. 

Gameplay rating: 6/10

[h1]Audio[/h1]
Luckily things shine here just like in the story. Voice acting is pretty good, there's some obviously bad voices due to it releasing 20 years ago but even by Today's standards, some of the more important ones are still good. 

The soundtrack is what builds the game's atmosphere and pushes it to eleven. Every location has its own unique music and they are incredibly atmospheric and moody, and fit well with the vampires and the whole night city vibes. 

As for the rest of the sound effects, from guns to ambient, they are below average, sad to say. Very low quality and muffled but I suppose that's part of the game's age. 

Audio rating: 8/10

[h1]Graphics, performance and tech analysis[/h1]
Let me start with the great, the atmosphere. It's perfect and it aged like a fine wine. The different places you visit are all unique and oozing with night time atmosphere. It's always great to explore and the game always feels varied in this regard. Whoever designed the maps clearly had talent and knew what he was doing. 

Visually it looked fine 20 years ago, though I don't think it has aged very well, at least, characters-wise. The biggest problem though are the bugs. At launch, it was a huge mess, so big that people could not even finish the game for many years until someone decided to fix what the devs abandoned. And those people have been fixing the game ever since. Sadly, some things will forever remain broken and even if you're using the unofficial patch, expect a ton of issues. 

Graphics, performance and tech analysis score: 7.5/10

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
If you never played this, you probably should give it a try keeping in mind that it is a very old game with a lot of things that have not aged very well and a lot of technical issues but if you can get past those, expect to be immersed in one of the best and unique atmospheres ever made.

2600,"It's a good game, but getting into it nowadays requires a lot of patience. Partly due to bugs - nothing game-breaking, but I had to give up on a couple of sidequests simply because of weird NPC behavior or quest items not spawning. But also, after becoming used to modern RPGs with a lot of hand-holding, diving blindly into Bloodlines is pretty taxing.
I've considered dropping the game multiple times, mostly after getting to Chinatown. But the desire to learn more about the world, and how this story ends made me keep coming back.
I'm glad I played this, since Bloodlines is one-of-a-kind game even now, but I doubt I would ever replay it. Maybe if the game gets a remake - it definitely needs one.",True,12

2610,"GUN is basically red dead before red dead was red dead, although done so much goofier. It wants to be a really deep storyline, but it's waaaaaaaaaaaaay too fast paced and erratic to land the impact. Still the story levels are fun and have a certain dated spectacle to them. Combat is breezy, and the short length honestly works for the size of the game world, which is admittedly just a little bigger than Ocarina of Time so it's not massive, but it does work. It's a weirdly ambitious time capsule, poorly aged in so many ways, but still weirdly fun to play for its snappy, arcadey action and enjoyable presentation. Also, the voice cast is so, so unnecessarily awesome, with Thomas Jane, Brad freakin' Dourif, and Ron motherfvckin' Pearlman are just a few of the great character actors here, and while the performances aren't outstanding, they are a lot of fun.

I will say, though, the game puts its worst foot forward, with a very early mission having you slaughtering indigenous people on a bridge. It's done without a shred of irony, and it's honestly really gross no matter how you slice it. I can easily see someone being turned off of that. Additionally, there are Chinese indentured servants that are not well done either. It's all super dated, and really gross. I wonder if there's a mod to make it not the worst thing somehow. Deadwood this ain't, so these more overtly messed up elements aren't done with any depth or understanding.

The rest of the game is enjoyable, if you're in the mood for a game equivalent of a B movie western. It's dated, charmingly so most of the time (but it does have some gross crap in it that I could see being tough to get by).",True,4

2610,"So we got a few good titles in the western genre and they all got a bit sweeped under the rag after Red Dead Redemption came along. 

One of the oldies is GUN. It is an action adventure with a semi-open world. It isn't the prettiest game, but it really does achieve a lot in terms of placing the player in the western setting. It really feels nice to jump on horse and go through the prairie. It is dated in every way - graphics, controls, camera, gameplay, but it is still surprisingly playable and if RDR is already boring you but you want more western games this one might be interesting to try. The world is semi open what I mean is that you can get to many places from the very beginning but there won't be anything happening there so there is no point. Following the storyline and side quests is really the only viable way of playing. 

The story goes through every western cliche you can imagine but it does it in style so by all means leave the seriousness outside as this one is for the fun of it and not rich sad story to be analyzed for deeper meaning.",True,2

But I saw this by chance again recently and you know I definitely was going to pick it up. The game doesn't look as good as I remember it, but it sure is a nostalgia moment to be playing it. I would definitely recommend it if you're looking for an awesome story set in the wild west.",True,1

Enemies shoot not only at you but also at your brothers in arms, and this leads you to play not only by shooting enemies but also by trying to make sure your comrades don't die.

2630,"Ah yes, one of the classic COD games that everyone either played during their childhood, or their early adult years. Unless; you're not a filthy zoomer like a lot of users are and were born in the 80s. While COD 1 is trying to find their footing within the genre of WW2 shooters, COD 2 is when Activision slowly finding their style of ""boots-to-the-ground"" action.

For me, Call of Duty has always been the ol' ""Boots-to-the-ground"" action spectacle that they made out of themselves during the Classic and the Golden ages of COD. But, COD 2 is the one that takes the ""Boots-to-the-ground"" and run an entire mile with it. There's no brakes in COD 2, since most of the time you are a grunt (either in a unit of renown, or some random unit), fighting in a battle until the credits roll. From this, there's staple mechanics that appear within the COD as a whole.

First of all, regenerating health. I'm no snob who says ""health regen isn't realistic"", as COD were never meant to be a realistic game. Besides, with the fact that most enemies are hitscans and the battle takes place between 20-40 NPCs at once; its improbable that you have to place Health Pickups every 10-20 meters with the intensity that COD 2 takes in. COD 1's intensity is fine as is, and adding regenerating health doesn't do anything within that game. With the addition of health regen, Infinity Ward can throw higher amounts of enemies within the screen, which is the goal of COD 2 to begin with - to push the new engine they have to its potential.

Second of all, grenade indicator and how you throw the grenades. Quick throw has always been a COD staple, and it starts from this game specifically if I remember. The amount of times that grenades save you in COD is immeasurable, and a quick button to access them is a welcome addition. Due to the fact that enemies also love using grenades in COD 2, the addition of grenade indicator is a good idea on how screwed you are. Depending on the difficulty, the enemies either seldom throw grenades, or loves throwing grenades.

Of course, the best part of classic COD is how moddable it is. It seems modding for Call of Duty ends with Black Ops 2, so take that as you wish.",True,1

This game is still actively supported by the developer.  I got a response in a very short time on their discussion forums.

Graphics are unique and interesting.  

Sounds and Music 9/10

Sounds and graphics are near perfect for its genre.

Gameplay is awesome.  Always something interesting and it is enough that you will be enjoying it for months to come.

Bugs and Execution:  Occassionally server connection time outs but the game it self has no bugs and runs flawlessly on  XP , and windows 7. (I have not tested it on windows  8 or 8.1)

2720,"This is literally the saddest story in my steam library. This awesome game went from hundreds of people playing it during the open beta - every server full, every new server instantly filling - to dead in months. Why? Price. Hyperbol was $20 for most of its lifespan, and while it's still not technically dead, it's still also not $5 (e: Oh hey, this happened, wonder when). This game would have been a tremendous success had it come out as a F2P game (something Steam didn't support back in 2007) but instead the developers were stubborn and steadfast in killing their own game.

There is literally no reason for this to be more than $5 right now. I say that as someone who waited for the pre-purchase to end in 2007 so that I could pay the full price for the game. It was worth $20 then, but now? Well, there's not a single active game to be found, unless you like playing with half-baked AI. Should this ever go on sale for less than $2, I'm buying it for 20 people on my friends list. Take that as you will.

2022 Update 

I want to be clear that I do not recommend you purchase this game without a plan. There is no way it is an enjoyable experience with no one else playing (it really needs a full game to be fun, and really needed a playerbase large enough to enable skill based match making which is what ultimately killed it) and I do not want you to waste $5 on a game that has been dead for over a decade. I still loved this game, and I think if you could arranged a group to play it somehow it would still be a fantastic experience and there's nothing else out there like it. That's why this review says ""Recommended"". Do not buy this without a plan or without the understanding that you're essentially buying a relic of the past.

Don't get me wrong, this is a phenomenal game and concept and some of the most fun I've ever had in a PVP-focused game. It was genius. Was. I think it was just before it's time, if it had come out maybe 5 years later it would have been able to thrive with a course adjustment to a F2P model probably. There was, in retrospect, a wealth of opportunity to make the game free and charge for ship customization, it just wasn't a common thing in 2007.

I cannot underscore enough how popular this game was during the free beta and how sharply its population dropped off when the $20 barrier to entry was erected. It was like instantaneous. Makes me sad to this day.",True,12
2720,"I havn't played this game to it's full extent yet but even though I was only able to play skirmish mode (due to lack of players being online), I still love this game.

I wish I played it back in it's heydey because the concept behind this is awesome. Multiple players on the same team are able to have different vehicles. Each vehicle has a moving/shooting/guarding sort of system. You can upgrade these systems accordingly right at the beginning or throughout the game. Careful though, when you do die you do have to upgrade your system again. Right click enables the aim, left click shoots, and space engages the weapon/defense at your will. You can move as you shoot, however moving is done in increments and there is a ""slow refill gas"" gauge indicating after moving that a certain amount of time is needed to recover and move again. Shooting is made easier by pressing the number 1 to scroll quicker through the weapons. 

If this game is on sale BUY IT! This is a game I'd hate to see be called a graveyard as it isn't because there is a lot here.

Only issues I face is there isn't very clear directions on what keys do what. Trying to play the gravitron game for instance, it says press start to begin and there is no start button on the keyboard. Maybe if I had an atari controller this would be a simple fix, but I don't have one, so many of the games I'm unable to play sadly. Second issue is that I am playing this on my Tv connected to my computer, and when I press esc to go back to the main menu to play a different game, I get black screen that stays that way until I ctrl, alt, delete and end program. Not very fun to have to do that every time. Could be a resolution problem because of how big the tv is but I've had similar issues on my pc screen with this game as well.

2800,"While the character graphics in the cut scenes aren't great and the dialogue is a bit, er, wooden by today's modern standards, X2: The Threat is a great introduction to trading-based games, and the space shooter elements are pretty fun.  The plotline is pretty simple and if you're not interested in that it can be safely ignored from quite early in the game, and the player can then focus on the open-world, building an empire and blowing up bad guys.  I'd recommend it as an intro to the genre of space building/trading/shooting games.",True,2
2810,"After years of playing on and off again with over 500 hours both on and off Steam under my belt, I can say this is my favorite game. This won't be universal, though, as the game has a very large learning gap and very little instruction, coupled with a format of gameplay that is best discribed as ""love it or hate it"". The lack of a tutorial doesn't help.

For those wondering if this is worth playing or buying, one must ask themselved what do they want first. Do you want to be a pirate in space firing on ships outside of the areas controlled by the law, and don't mind the high dificulty? 
Do you want to spend many hours trading items from one station to another to gain money and eventually buy your own states, hiring ships to trade for you and leading your new found corporate empire to grand wealth? 
Do you want to explore the universe, and all it's mystory and see it's dark secrets, with all the risks that may bring? 
Do you want to be a cop, shooting down pirates, evil robots, evil incests and whom ever else may oppose order?
This and much more is in the game.

However: if you want instant gratification, always playing at a fast pace, or everything being handed to you?
Then this game is not for you.

This game isn't for those who want to just jump in and do everything quickly, it's a slow buildup that some will find enjoyable and some will find unbearable.",True,299

You can build stuff, you can build stuff that builds stuff AND you can build stuff that blows stuff up.  You can attach stuff that blows stuff up to stuff that moves, and you can make stuff that moves move around stuff that doesn't.  You can also watch the stuff you buillt up blow other stuff up, OR you can fly around in stuff you put stuff on and blow stuff up yourself.  It takes time to get some stuff done, and you do need patience to play if you want the best stuff or even a lot of stuff... even longer if you want a lot of the best stuff... but when you get a lot of the best stuff and throw it at a load of other stuff, the stuff that happens is pretty awesome stuff.

The economic system is quite impressives, with dozens of different space stations you can dock at, and trade with.  Eventually you can even build stations of your own.

2810,"X3 Reunion is a game of monstrous proportions. Everything in it is vast and massive in a way that's both exciting and daunting. It is relatively easy to get overwhelmed by the sheer scope of the game and the lack of any sort of proper guiding hand to teach you the basic will make many newcomers run for the hills. If you stick it out however you will find that underneath it all is one of the best open space games since the last game from the X series.

Reunion picks up where X2 left off and starts you as Julian Brennan once again. Your trade empire from the previous game destroyed by the Khaak you now have to resurrect it from the ashes, if that's what you want. The story missions available are in true X style utterly forgettable and easily missable. They can even be disabled entirely by picking from one of several sandbox starts this time around.

As always you start you start your adventure in the X universe in a small dingy of a space worthy craft and set about making your mark on the galaxy. How you do this is entirely up to you, you can trade, fight, explore however you like and in whichever forms you want. Some players might want to avoid the fighting aspect entirely and just set up a gigantic trading empire. Others might want to sustain themselves through pirate activity. The beauty of the X games have always been the choice they give you in going what you want to do, you are never forced to fight or forced to trade, it's all entirely up to you how you want to proceed from any given position.

Reunion is not without it's faults however and in this case, it's the bugs top the list. The game was almost completely unplayable at launch and while patches have managed to remove most if not all of the problems it is still not an issue that is so easily forgivable.

Graphically is where the game is truly impressive however, never before has space looked this beautiful and the objects that inhabit it looked this crisp. Every new sector you visit has a sense of uniqueness about it that just makes you want to keep going to see what's in the next one. The ships are beautifully detailed and the background ambient images of stars, nebulae and planets tickle the imagination. This is indeed one stunning visual experience.

The soundtrack is the standard space opera opus that we have heard so many times before, it doesn't detract anything from the experience but it doesn't add anything to it either. Luckily it is easy enough to disable the ingame music and put whatever you feel is appropriate on the stereo. The voice acting you encounter throughout the game, from the missions to your ships onboard computer voice, is downright atrocious however and take you out of the game with an annoying level of certainty.

All in all X3 Reunion is a solid continuation of the X saga, building on the foundations that has remained mostly unchanged since the very first game. Should you desire an open ended space epic then this is the game for you. If you have the stamina to get into the learn the ropes then X3 is as good as it gets, at least until the next X game is released.",True,60
2810,"Total play time: 43 hours before I gave up in disgust.
Crashes: too many to count.

The good: 
lovely graphics. (When you can see them beside the immovable overlay screens.)

The really ugly:
Worst user interface of any game I've EVER played. Confusing. Redundant. And impossible to actually FIND anything if you don't already know EXACTLY where it is.

Flight mechanics: ships in space aren't air fighters. or worse cars in mud.  Why can't SPACE simulations get this right?  If I shut off the engines, I don't just bloody stop. I keep going. But not in this game. Freelancer got it right, and it made space combat FUN. Others never seem to have learned the lesson. If I want an air-based dogfight game, I'll go get that, not a game that's theoretically based in space.

Mouse resolution seem to be hard-coded rather than depending on operating system settings, then they don't give you a means to reduce the sensitivity. So if you have a high resolution mouse, hope you like making micrometre movements to control things. Or go with a joystick, which isn't nearly as precise - and you have to be VERY precise when shooting because there's zero give.

Stupidly high learning curve, and (almost) zero tutorial. Examples:
-- In the FIRST tutorial (simulator) mission, you're told ""don't forget to activate your turret"" - and left with ZERO instructions on how to do that. You're on your own trying to figure out what you need. I did eventually figure it out, several hours into the game, and the answer is nowhere NEAR the weapon options panel they provide. 
-- They give you a jump drive? You have to ""just know"" that you need lots of energy crystals for it, and where and how to get them. 
-- Want to activate your jump drive? You better ""just know"" that it's going to make you stop in space with a big flashing ""Hi, I'm a target"" for a while. So although the enemy can jump as soon as they're in trouble, you trying to do so means certain death.
-- Want to buy something? Who created that interface? Wasn't anyone with any kind of user interface knowledge. 
-- Want to do some trading? Well, it seems you don't have the trading interface. Except you DO have the trading interface, says so right in your ship inventory. Finally discovered that it's not the right LEVEL of trading interface, which is given a different name in the error message than it has in the inventory. Again, you just have to know. 
-- The list goes on, and on, and on. Sadly, most of the online advice is written by people who HAVE that encyclopaeodic knowledge and forgot that they didn't once have it. 
-- Regularly throughout the campaign you're told ""meet you at XXX"". Without being given ANY hints as to where it might be. Having to go to external sources just so you can actually figure out where you're supposed to next is definitely poor design.
-- Attempting to build a ""factory complex"" is an exercise in frustration since the positioning controls were done by someone who had never, ever used any kind of CAD program. It's what I'd expect out of a novice doing a project for a Bachelor level graphics class, and even then they probably wouldn't get a good grade. It's not something I would ever have expected out of a commercial product such as this one.
-- The list of faults goes on, and on, and on.

And, finally, the kicker: the storyline breaks. Hard. With no way to figure out how the hell to fix it. Mission 7, finding the crystals, your contact doesn't show up where they're supposed to be, which means no way to continue. Since I've spent several hours between the previous mission and this one trying to earn enough credits to get a better ship, I have NO idea where it might have gone wrong.  
I might as well have started one of the ""no storyline"" missions, because this one is now totally hooped.

Not to mention crash after crash after crash making game (almost) unplayable. Latest one? You finish a long mission (only the 2nd or 3rd one) with zero chance of saving and... it just hangs there, staring at the piece the Talon just dropped, keyboard locked. Did I mention no chance of saving and no quick-saves so you have to repeat the whole, long, frustrating experience rather than restart from further along the mission line.  Worse, apparently there's a way to save without docking, as I was reminded by the game when it misinterpreted my ""fire at the enemy"" for ""save this game"", but I was defeated in trying to figure out where or how to purchase the necessary bits and pieces to make it possible. I'm pretty good at figuring things out usually, but this game is that obtuse.

I was REALLY looking forward to playing this game. But as it stands, it's an unplayable mash of crap that requires an encyclopaedic knowledge of the game JUST TO PLAY THE FIRST BLOODY MISSIONS! 

I'm sure the game is fun for those who took the hours and hours to develop that encyclopaedic knowledge required to do even the most basic tasks in the game. For someone like me who doesn't mind some complexity, but would rather just get in and play before I'm hit with the whole enchilada, this game isn't for me. Or for anyone else who feels that it shouldn't be necessary to digest a 96 page manual, megabytes of online information, and go through several hours of online learning just to complete the first few missions.

Annoying. Very annoying.

edit: 8-Mar: yet I still intend to master this game. Yes, it's annoying in so many ways, but hopefully once I *have* acquired the required encyclopaedic knowledge (or at least a portion thereof) it gets better? Certainly has promise, I just hope it can realize that promise.

edit: 11-Mar: after trying for many hours to get this game to work, all I can say is ""no, not for me"". If you want a game that takes hours of research just to START the game, and many more hours of external out-of-game research to even have a hope in hell of doing anything, then you might try this game. If you want something fun, not frustrating in the extreme, and something that doesn't resemble more of an office job than a ""game"", stay away. Far, far away. Personally, I'm giving up in disgust.",False,31
2810,"This is a really tough review to write as I really wanted this game to be great.  I am still a big fan of X-Tension and after the disappointment of X2, I hoped this game had brought X back to its roots.  Things started out fine I guess but as with many things the devil was in the detail.  Perhaps it's just my playing style that's the problem but generally I found the game to be quite frustrating in many areas.

Let's discuss the good parts first though.

The graphics were fantastic.   It was great to have new models for the bases that provided you with both the wow factor and a subtle sense of familiarity at the same time.  I liked the fact that many of the bases were exactly where they were to be found in X.  Obviously the Khaak war had had an impact and that was to be expected but navigation was less of an issue than I thought it was going to be.  I also like the fact that the trading ships you set up for your bases don't seem to travel into sectors where you haven't been.  Makes it easy for ships not to get caught up in conflict that way, although that still happens as we'll discuss later.  Once you learn the new interface, it's remarkably similar to what has come before.  That (for me at least) meant that the learning curve was not as steep as it could have been because of the known complexity of the game.  Once the game was started, many of the basics were identical and it was the kind of game that I could seriously get into because I understood what was required and how to start making money.

Sector traders was another advance I thought very useful.  Being able to assign a ship to a sector then just let it find good trading deals and execute them for money was a great idea.  Didn't always work very well but then I seemed to be competing with every AI trader in the sector also; very realistic, but not a lot of fun.

The combat model seemed to be upgraded and I liked it a lot as the weapons worked more like those I'd seen on other games like Freelancer.  Not having to stop and adjust for recoil all the time was a bonus and in that sense, the game flowed a lot better than X.

The single biggest improvement to the game was docking.  You didn't need the docking computer to make things easier like you did in X because docking seriously wasn't that hard.  No longer was docking a perilous affair for a budding pilot; it was quite forgiving so long as you weren't reckless.

Unfortunately, there were many aspects of the game that were 'upgraded' causing unanticipated issues.  While docking was in fact my favourite upgrade, it caused other problems.  Ships were now vulnerable on the outside of their stations.  This was no doubt by design, but it meant that there was no 'safe' place to park.  In addition, every docking ring had 5 slots on it so you couldn't park all your spare ships there without disrupting trade or having some of your ships pushed off the ring from time to time.  Additionally, the AI driving the ships (particularly wingmen) didn't handle the parking very well which meant that I was regularly losing wingmen who crashed into the station I'd docked at by accident.  Docking had become great for me but hopeless for any ship I wasn't personally driving which caused me no small amount of frustration.  Additionally, in X I was used to having a small fleet of wingmen around me and I couldn't do that in this game because I would just jam up the docking ring.  Given that your player ship is exposed, wouldn't it have made more sense for the wingmen to switch to patrolling outside the station instead?

Then there's the Corvettes.  You're supposed to be able to dock a M5 fighter on them.  Nope.  Doesn't seem to work.  Not sure what that's about but I couldn't EVER get that to work.  As a side point, back on the old THQ forum (under the handle Acid) I suggested a ship of this kind originally; could dock a single small ship, have a reasonably large cargo hold and still be combat effective.  You couldn't imagine my delight at actually being able to fly one; I planned to use the M5 as a resource collector as I took mine through space.  Too bad it just never worked out. Loved those ships but it was a shame they didn't perform as advertised.

That of course leads to the Reputation system.  Sure you can buy our ships; so long as you're at a particular level with us.  Actually, I understand that one.  I was surprised it wasn't in X in the first place; but, it was very frustrating nonetheless to have to build up reputation with a specific race to buy their good stuff.  I'm not against the idea but it would have been great to have a system option to turn it either on or off.

System fog was to me one of the poorest choices that could have been made.  I understand the benefit it gives in some systems but I'm not always playing to overcome such challenges.  I would have been happy with no fog, or an option to turn it off.

Finally, there was the ship models.  While the stations had been dramatically improved, the ships all looked like modern houses; same structure and internal design, different facade on the outside to make them stand out.  Yes, I liked the original models but it's more than just a case of nostalgia; it was the diversity of ship design that stood out for me with the original X.  In this new one, with the exception of the Boron ships you would be hard placed to notice anything but superficial design differences between the races.  Even ships within the race seemed only to significantly differ in scale.

Don't get me wrong; I liked the game.  I liked the atmosphere, I liked most of the game mechanics except those mentioned above.  I just found the game a bit of a struggle because of the small niggles that make it difficult to play.  In some respects, X has joined the ranks of Master of Orion (IMHO) in forming a new genre of game only to make it harder to play in every subsequent iteration through over-complication.  MOO (the original) is still a great game, and I still play it despite owning 2 and 3 (and several other 4x games).  At this stage, I suspect I'll be saying the same thing about X-Tension.  I'll still be playing that in years to come (probably with an emulator named something like WinBox on a 256-bit cloud OS) instead of X3.  That will be a shame because this game got a lot right.  It was just a little too complicated and clunky in spots.",False,26
2810,"This game appears to be working fine since it was bugged at it's first release. Although the navigation and space stations seem a bit more awkward compared to the original and X2. But the most interesting part is more weapons, ships and hidden secrets within this game.

You may get used to it over time, but you never know - as you may find this game not so boring as you got lots to explore the galaxy. And this game is open-ended and never stops, despite its linear storyline.

 I give this game a  7.0

",True,89
2900,"A classic in the submarine simulation genre. The missions may be canned - with no random variation aside from random box patrols and units reacting to you - but the sim gameplay itself is great. When it came out, it pretty much blew the competition out of the water. You know, just like the ships in the game itself.

The graphics and presentation are obviously dated, but still have a certain charm. You don't really play naval sims for the graphics, anyway. Just wait until it's on sale so you actually get decent value, and yes, it does go on sale. Of course, the key word here is [i]simulator[/i], 'cause it's pretty close to one. If you're not at least a little interested in submarines, or unwilling to study the manual, you won't have a very good time.


Gameplay consists of navigating your vessel, an improved Los-Angeles class submarine, and completing objectives such as sinking enemy ships and laying mines. Most of this is done through looking at and manipulating instrument panels, though there are map screens and an exterior 3D view.

To get a general idea of what it's like, this is a boat that sails [i]under[/i] the water. Your primary means of figuring out where the Hell you are involves bouncing sound waves off everything - which is called sonar as it sounds cool - because you sure as hell don't have any windows. You may feel that this isn't as easy as navigating in a regular boat (well, regular boat simulator anyway) and you'd be right.

And that's just basic sailing. When you're facing enemy vessels, it can get pretty tense. Overall, when you learn enough to get the hang of it, 688(I) can make for a good challenge. You can also upgrade your sub and your crew between missions with earned points, and change your weapons loadout while in port.

I have not played far enough into the campaign missions yet to really judge the plot or tone of the game. Suffice to say however, 688(I) Hunter-Killer is a hardcore military simulation. You don't play this [i]just[/i] for the story. From what I've gathered so far, it's strait-laced enough that you'll probably feel like an actual Navy officer - any moral objections you may encounter will have to come from your own self. There is the option of ending your mission at any point, which if you haven't completed many objectives will get you chewed out. You cannot, however, talk back or go AWOL. Also of note is the scenario editor, as well as the number of custom scenarios available on fansites.


The submarine controls themselves are sensibly laid out and pretty easy to use once you know how. Of course, this game made the Guinness Book of World Records 1999-2000 as 'Most Intellectually Challenging PC Game', and while I probably wouldn't call it the hardest game in existence anymore, I'd say the difficulty still holds up. It's certainly far from impossible and pretty fun to learn the ship's systems, but operating them under pressure is another thing. Having the assistants enabled helps.

You unfortunately cannot access any proper tutorials in-game. There are tutorial missions available to play, short tutorial videos in the game directory accessible from the splash screen and a comprehensive PDF manual is included. You [i]will[/i] need to read the manual - I recommend putting it on a tablet to consult while underway.

All that said, 688(I) was released in 1997. It may not run that well on modern systems, even if it runs well on mine (Windows 10 64-bit). The naval combat packs it comes in are rather pricey, too; you should wait for a sale.


The Steam version of 688(i) is the latest patched version, 1.08, initially a re-release of the game in 2006. Random fun fact: this game used to be published by EA.

This game's music is of special mention. It's around 8 or so MIDI tracks, and it's the sort of techno-suspense stuff you might hear from a more subdued Tom Clancy film. You can download it [url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7RRcwFJCj2FaVBXT3hsaHFRS3c/edit?usp=sharing]here[/url] and get some of the songs from the game remixes in MP3 format from [url=http://community.simtropolis.com/topic/53736-simcity-2000-music-retexture/]here[/url]. They're very good and very appropriate.

You can also watch the special promo/press kit/B roll video they release [url=https://archive.org/details/hunter_killer_b_roll]here[/url]. Pretty fascinating glimpse into development, plus some gameplay on a period computer that's laughably slow compared to today.",True,43

I know what you're going to say next: ""Educational? You mean I have to learn stuff? I don't want that. I just want to jump into an FPS and play deathmatch with my buds"".

If that is your mindset then I'm afraid this game is not for you. 

What you have here is a highly detailed technical simulation of a modern-day fast attack submarine. When I say ""modern"" I mean 1997, but I don't think they've changed much since then. And don't let the original release date throw you off; this ""game"" is much more sophisticated than any games made today. And for 1997 it's a virtual milestone. The development company (Sonalysts) actually specializes in combat sims and they have worked closely with the U.S. Navy in producing training programs. They have developed other sub sims, which are also on Steam. The point being: they know their stuff!

If you want something with more visual flair then I would highly suggest any WW2 sub sim, especially any of the Silent Hunter games. As a matter-of-fact they are a must for anyone wanting to break into this genre. They will provide a basic understanding of how submarines work, and you won't be banging yourself over the head for making small mistakes. They are incredibly fun, and easy to jump in and learn too. Those will actually make learning the Sonalysts sims that much easier to comprehend. I'm no expert, however, and I only write this review as a student trying to help other students learn. WW2 sub sims have taught me a lot on a subject that, until a few months ago, I knew absolutely nothing about. Now I'm reading books on the subject and technical manuals as well.

Of course this is not something for everyone. It's very technical and there are no in-game tutorials to help you out. Even die-hard sub sim fans may be intimidated by the complicated interface. You won't find any hand-holding here, and you won't see much in the way of visual representation. When you're in a real submarine you are actually swimming blind, and this game captures that as accurately as it can. Luckily it comes with quite a lengthy manual so you better study that hard before playing. I'm still new to sub sims myself, but I'm moving at such a fast rate and I'm trying to learn as much as I can. I've downloaded the game's manual to an e-reader to study while I'm offline and it's very insightful.

This game is for those players who want to take sub simulation to the next level. But does a learning curve mean that the game is not fun? Of course not, but the education is part of the reward.",True,36
2900,"688(I) HUNTER/KILLER is an excellent game.  I've been playing it for years.

However....BEWARE Steam's version of this game as it is now bugged/unplayable...as of June 13, 2019.

As Steam has no true customer service; per se, and absolutely no person you could actually speak with, I now have a great game that can no longer be played....and zero Steam 'support' to remedy the problem. 

ALL of us whom purchased 688(I) HUNTER/KILLER are now unable to play the game, thanks to a Steam auto-update which adds the virus into the mix.  DO NOT BUY THE GAME FROM STEAM.  You'll find yourself with a game you cannot play. 

The game's 688I_HK.exe executable program contains a TROJAN.  This particular trojan WILL immediately corrupt your computer's registry, rename and add itself to your Windows startup routine.

I've been playing it since 1999, and I don't see a reason to stop.",True,29
2900,"This is a great submarine simulation game.  I felt right in the middle of the action, and there are definitely some tense moments, i.e. evading enemy torpedoes and stealthily sneaking up on an enemy submarine.  The game has a steep learning curve at first if you've never played anything like it before.  I recommend reading the captain's manual if you want some early pointers on how to learn the basics.  Some of the missions take multiple hours to complete, and I found it easy to lose myself in the game.  It's got simplistic graphics, as it is an older game.  On Windows 7 platforms, I've noticed that the game doesn't run as reliably as older versions of Windows, i.e. random crashing in the middle of missions for no reason.  That seems to be one of the only downfalls that I have come across.  Other than that, definitely a thumbs up.",True,19
2900,"If you like submarins, this is a nice game to learn all about them.
The drawback is TIME. Everything goes so slowly and, you are so blind that the game can be really frustrating.
Maybe a good simulation but, a game needs something else to be attractive to the player.
Buy if you like submarins and the price is a bargain",True,17
2900,"This is an extremely old game based on a submarine simulator in a war scenario. You are essentially taking control of a submarine in midst of combat. It is definitely not a game for everybody. It is a realistic simulator of what a person in a submarine needs to do in order to survive and fight. It isn't your casual arcade game where you're controlling a submarine from the outside swimming around blowing up battleships. 

It definitely takes a while to get used to because there's a lot that needs to be learned when first playing. The tutorials do give you an insight of what does what but for something so complex it doesn't explain 'too well' in my opinion. I still have trouble playing the game and can't really enjoy it even after looking at tutorials. That being said, it's recommended for people who enjoy realistic simulators (that do not include jokes such as Grass Simulator or Goat Simulator) and have at least a good amount of knowledge and terminology for these types of settings.

It is relentless and confusing as all hell but if you get the controls down I'm sure it isn't half bad.

It isn't my cup of tea but it does pose as a pretty realistic simulator, although not graphically. 
As a game, I do not recommend it but as a simulator, it is pretty good at what it is. 

As for recommendations, I can't really put it on either side but every review is subjective and based on my experience, it wasn't as enjoyable as I really wanted it to be. 

But to be fair:
[h1] It is good for people who enjoy realistic simulators (specifically submarines and war), but is not good to be seen as a casual game. [/h1]

The campaign debriefings are intentionally cheesy, I think it sort of loses some realism there but it's also a bit funny, so it's a wash.  It could stand to use some extra features that were included with the sequel, Sub Command, but I wouldn't recommend that one due to the overwhelming bugs.",True,13

2920,"It works in Windows 11

The interface improvements are undeniable, however the game as a whole feels inferior to the prior installment 688(I) Hunter/Killer.

In 688(I) Hunter/Killer you had crew experience points, Sub  upgrades, at the end of the mission you had to transmit an status report, and you also had a few live action videos. All those features are missing in this new game.

The game has several issues, some of them are game design issues and other are bugs. I had the impression that the enemy subs always have better sonar and better torpedoes than you, also your Fire Control AI is almost useless sometimes sending torpedoes in a completely different direction. The player's log was better on the past game because it recorded only the first successful attempt instead of all like this game does. 

Among the bugs you have: 

Flying Submarines
Ships entering land
Submarines moving at 100 kts
Torpedos failing for no reason.
Surface ships invisible to torpedos

sometimes these bugs can make the mission completion impossible.

You can still have fun with some missions, but the game as a whole feels like a chore due to the problems mentioned above, I recommend you to start with 688(I) Hunter/Killer and then try this one.

2990,"This game is better than FlatOut 1, but the lows of this game are horrible. One of FlatOut's most popular game modes is the Derby. Sadly, the derbies are just idiotic, you can destroy 3 opponents and only get second or third place; this has happened to me multiple times. Why is a mode about destroying all your enemies scored on (irrational) SCORE rather than PLACEMENT? Getting first place is basically a random roll of the dice. Wreckfest does derbies much better. Another trash mechanic is the special events. These are extremely difficult and offer no fun. Not to mention, the tutorials are garbage. Some of the modes I've seen are high jumping and bowling. You'd think combining bowling and racing would use your car as the bowling ball, right? But, unfortunately, no. Instead, you have to jump out of your car and pray for your tiny character to knock down all the gigantic pins. Does this sound fun? Of course not, it is a bad game mode. Fortunately, the racing itself is actually pretty solid, and slamming into other racers is always great. Visual design and graphics are also a big factor on whether I like a game and this game is great in both departments.

The cars are all Volkswagons, from the early eighties Golf GTi to late 90's concept, old and new Beetles are included and even the VW Camper. You can customise most of the parts, by winning races and spending your prize money, but this is not a sim. Most customisations make very little difference to performance unless they boost the BHP. It takes some practice to consistently win events and opponents are challenging but a bit stupidly rough, bashing you off the track if they can. A real bonus in a game like this is the availabilty of a cockpit view, making it more realistic and challenging.

3020,"This is the game your mom refers to when she tells you ""you already have Red Dead Redemption at home"" when you ask her to buy you the actual RDR. The game isn't necessarily terrible, but it can be difficult to get into. There's a decent amount of jank that's going to make this game frustrating and head scratching to play at times. Many sections you are tasked with finding X item or escaping or reaching point Y and the game will give absolutely no hint or inclination as to where or what you're supposed to do and you'll eventually ask yourself frustratingly ""where/what the fuck do I do"" before you fumble into the solution. So at times a bit frustrating but also at times the game is actually pretty fun to play when you're in gunfights that sprawl throughout an entire town mowing down bad guys as the vengeful ""right hand of God"" The Reverend Ray. On the flip side it can also be quite a drag when you're having to sneak through locations or perform not so good first person platforming as the other character, Billy Candle. 

In addition to featuring unique gameplay scenarios, each character comes with their own story that is sometimes interwoven. For instance, The Reverend gets the bulk of the action in gunfights and showdowns, while Billy is usually more stealthy and has to run or escape from situations by using the previously mentioned platforming leaving his sections to feel less fun than The Reverend's. The game looks fine for its time being a game from 2007 though there are moments where the game looks technically impressive with the lighting being really well done and is especially noticeable when traversing the many forest themed locations in the game. Ultimately the graphics aren't much to boast about while the soundtrack save for a few tracks is also largely unforgettable as well. 

I bought this along with its predecessors Bound in Blood and Gunslinger. I was tempted to play just those two after reading some not so glowing reviews about the first one. Overall, I'm glad I checked it out. Getting to play as a Bible quote spewing (there's a dedicated Bible button with verses), plate body armor wearing, bad ass preacher who cuts down the evil and wicked while dual wielding revolvers was easily worth the dollar and odd change I spent to own the first game. If you're a fan of Western themed video games and you've already experienced the emotional roller coasters of RDR 1 and 2 then you might find this interesting. While it's nowhere near as emotionally rich and complex as the aforementioned titles it still has a pretty fun, spaghetti Western style vibe with its classic revenge tale that even has a few cool surprises in its story, especially near the end.

3050,"Let's be honest here, there are so many great rally games available on modern platforms, Here are some reasons you should not spend your time here and instead play one of those games instead (I played entirely in simulation mode)
- Every car regardless of tyres feels like it is driving on black ice at all times and wants to spin
- Random rocks strewn across the edge and sometimes the very middle of the road, causing you to flip and total your car out of nowhere
- Sometimes you will hit the wall *slightly* too hard and your driver will literally die, forcing you to go back in the career mode, even better when this happens when landing a jump the developers put in on purpose
- The offroad trucks randomly flip 90 degrees onto their side at the slightest change in elevation
- Worse tracks than the original game
- Often runs at over 700 frames per second, causing some rather bad screen tearing issues
- Sometimes the brakes do not work and the car speeds up instead in a corner as you fly off the track

Positives to playing both Xpand Rally and Xpand Rally Xtreme:

3130,"Men of War: Red Tide is a strategy game developed by Digitalmindsoft and published by 1C Company. This game was released in November 2009 and is a sequel to Men of War. It is set in World War II and features a campaign that recounts history of the Soviet Union and its battles through a 20 mission campaign. I personally really enjoyed its predecessor Men of War, but this game is terrible. Furthermore, I wanted to like this game, but I quit after 90 minutes and on the second mission and uninstalled it after giving up. I want to shed some thoughts on why I think its bad because their are many individuals that enjoy this game. Therefore, this review will discuss the positives and negatives of this game.

I am familiar with the gameplay and overall feel of the game due to playing Men of War, which is very similiar. You command your squad and you order them to attack in order for you to complete your objectives. This game is realistic  because for instance, tanks destroy infantry, infantry can kill in one shot, and infantry must use tactics to get close to the tank to destroy it. Furthermore, it promotes strategy through tactics and I commend this. There is the micromanagement of supplies aspect in this game, which I adore and was seen in Men of War. The idea coincides with realism as your soldiers need to steal medical supplies and ammo from dead soldiers inventories after using ammo or those supplies. These two positives are standard in the Men of War series, as I did play the later released Men of War: Assault Squad.

There are two negatives in this game that annoyed me and/or made me quit. The lighter negative is the voice acting. As this is set in the viewpoint of Russia, I was confused on why American voice actors were recounting battles in the loading screen prior to the battle and why there was mostly American voice actors having dialogue in battles. If this was not confusing enough, the voice acting was bland as it feels overly scripted and not natural. Moving on, the main negative is the AI, which is absolutely awful and made me quit. I am not the only one that has experienced bad AI as many negative reviews for this have reinforced that notion. For instance, your objective is to neutralise the artillery so you need a responsive squad to get around the artilley and machine gun nests. The AI instead runs in circles after I order them to move, wonder whether to be prone, crouched, or standing, and does not automatically shoot the enemy in front of them. These three issues within the AI absolutely make me cringe because the idea of a non-responsive AI and a realistic game where they can easily die, it makes for a terrible playing experience. I feel this game has gone backwards because Men of War featured solid AI that was responsive and tactical and this being the sequel has ruined the series for me.

I did not want to downright bombard this game with negative comments because I enjoy the overall gameplay mechanics and atmosphere of the game, hence the positive comments that this game expands upon following the first game. But, the negatives of voice acting and mainly the AI have made me uninstall this game within 90 minutes unfortunately. This is a personal review so as mentioned before, not everyone will agree with this but coming from a strategy fan, its unfortunate I experienced this. I recommend avoiding this game.

3130,"My men were advancing on my third try to get off the beach, not in a great way, but they were moving.  The enemy barely noticed as long as we didn't shoot.  oops, stepped in the wrong spot and triggered a story advace, and now we're surrounded.  Ok, the enemy is following a scripted path to somewhere on the other side of the map and running straight past my men.  We're shooting well and mowing them down!  wait, why is no one shooting?  oh, they only came with a handfull of bullets for their automatic weapons?  well crap, ok, no problem, we'll scavenge from the dead.  Here goes 30 to 40 minutes of micromanaging ammo, grenades, and bandages to each guy...  Oh look, I was given re-inforcements.  Ok another 30 minutes to get them all squared away with ammo.  Got some tanks to blow up, neat.  Another 30 minutes to re-organize everyone with decent weapons to move forward.  Time to circle around these emplaced machine gunners aaaaand, crap, stepped in the wrong spot and fast forwarded the mission's scripting again.  Ok, well, we won at least and my guys are ready for the next stage.  
Here we go, same map but it opened up a little, nice way of doing it.  Lets get the squad with the machine guns and flame throwers up to...  wait a sec.  Where the hell are the machine guns and flame throwers I maticulously collected from the fallen before the map shifted?  And no one has shit for ammo?   WTF?!?!?!  Aaaaaand I'm out.  
If you're going to make me organize it all manually after saving my guys from a quick out-matched demise, don't f'ing take it all away to shift the map a few yards north.  That's lazy coding and nothing more.
I love micromanaging my stuff to achieve a good outcome.  I don't love finding out I wasted my time after being forced to do it in the first place.",False,22

[h1][b]General Impression[/b][/h1]
[quote]Men of War: Red Tide is a nice strategy game. The graphics and the textures are pretty nice. The atmosphere mostly happens in areas with water surrounding them, such as islands, coasts, etc. The battles also happen in villages, towns, forests, fields, military bases (pretty rare) and even other environments. The audio is pretty nice, I like the sound of everything. What is pretty noticeable: the guns’ sounds. They are pretty loud. This makes the game more realistic. The music is nice, especially the menu one, it really makes you feel nationalist. The gameplay is complex, in each mission you have to complete a lot of tasks, alike killing specific enemies, destroying specific units, combating all enemies on the map, reaching a certain point, etc. The story focuses on the Russian side, which, in this game, will have various battles with the Germans, Italians and the Romanians. It has 6 campaigns. Some of them are long, some of them are medium and 2 of them are short. The missions, which describe the story, happen in places where in the real-life soldiers also fought, due to the fact that this game is a RTS. The user interface is well-optimized, with no bugs and well-synthetized information. I also like the overall design of it. The controls are pretty good, except with 1 thing: the rotations’ controls of the cameras. I highly recommend you to reset them with the arrow buttons. The engines, just like in every Men of War game, are not perfect. The game has rarely crashes, and when it crashes, you obviously lose the progress of your mission. Try and save the game as often as you can, in order to avoid too much progress lose. You don't want to waste your time by restarting the mission from zero, right? The mechanics are sophisticated, being pretty nice and everything moves well-optimized. I also like how the infantry moves on the hills. Now, I’m going to talk a little about the G.E.M. editor. Just like in every Men of War game, you have a G.E.M. editor. You can create your own battles in it. It is complex and with a various number of functions. What I don’t like in this particular G.E.M. editor: first of all, you can’t drive airplanes. That’s a shame, especially that airplanes feel pretty nice. You drive it in the air, you have the freedom to control it however you want. And secondly, the amount of content is not that extraordinary either. There is pretty much content, but compared to Men of War: Assault Squad (both 1 and 2), isn’t the same content-filled. But, since it was made in 2009, I could say that the content in this G.E.M. editor isn’t really a major problem. Overall, this game is a nice simulation of the Russian side of World War 2.[/quote]

3130,"Ну что, тяжелая стратегия, кидая сразу в гущу событий, дает под управление амрмию, противник, который всегда преобладает в колличестве и качестве, промахи в тактике не прощает совершенно и отряд который бъет в лоб разбивает без потерь, Правада в дальнейшем (на момент написания каментария прошел 1-ую главу) дают уже маленькие отряды и воевать приходится более продумано, т.к. пока контролируешь захват позиции одними, в других уже гранаты кидают. После любой перестрелки приходится чистить карманы противника ибо патроны у отряда не бесконечные и тратятся достаточно быстро, тоже самое с любой техникой.

Это не просто стратегия, а в неком роде симулятор военных действий, в большинстве случаев приходится работать в тылу и надо всегда проявлять извращенность ума, что бы отобрать или уничтожить военную технику противника.

9/10 thought process",True,20
3150,The Gm Rally is a alright kids game if you want to keep your little ones entertained for a bit. The graphics are simple and not the greatest. The sounds don't really feel like they are real. The controls are hard to control in game. Sometimes the car will turn to hard when you just want to make a soft turn. The Ai are really stupid and you should be able to ace everyone race. This is a game that should be bought in a pack with other games and not by itself. I liked playing it for a little while but there wasn't much content to the game. The game felt like it was a beta and not totally complete. I don't recommend this game to anyone looking for a good racing game. This is a game for those who don't need a challenge and want a good laugh at how your car is moving. Get this game for the kids but not yourself.,True,0

3170,This game holds up very well. To me its the best version of this type of game that I have played.,True,1
3200,"To quote ""Painkiller is Fucking Awesome"" Ben ""Yahtzee"" Croshaw, painkiller is fucking awesome. A wonderful retreat back into ""Shoot Everything That Moves"" land, Painkiller has a great sense of style, difficulty progression and zany weaponry. Each level has a cool concept, populated by equally atmospheric adversaries that are fun to eviscerate, explode, or pin to walls with your giant stake gun.  The final levle is an incredibly fun take on everyones favorite nine-tiered dungeon, and has to be played to be truly appreciated. 

The expansion ""Battle Out Of Hell"" continues with new weapons and more levels. Although many are equally as impressive as thier counterpars in the original game, the difficulty curve cuts far steeper, as Russian Suicide Bombers and Nazis...(Surprising they didn't make the cut for the original game really) will really test your skills in the Leningrad level. 

In all though, when you're tired of dealing with bland quests, uninspired plots or character, or even every sentient thing around you, it never hurts to fire up a game that rewards for simply murdering everything in-front of you.",True,183
3200,"One of the greatest shooters of the early 2000's.
Fatal1ty made a lot of money off this game and it was fun to watch.
MP is NOT DEAD in the EU from what Ive been told, but the N.A. scene is thin at best. The single player is a lot of fun, so there is always that to fall back to IF you can not find a game in the STATES.
Buy it when its on sale. You wont regret it.",True,150
3200,"CoD player? Read here then skip to the last lines: HOLY CRAP! WHAM! BLAM! COLORS! SOUNDS?! PEW PEW!

Do you actually take time to play and enjoy games? Read here: Get this game. It's really well made and worth your attention.

Autism? Social CONVENTIONS?! EYE CONTACT? WITH PEOPLE?!?!  :  This game does so many things right that they become nearly indiscernable until you stop to really look. In fact, the reason NONE of the Painkiller knockoffs have managed to be fun is apparent. Painkiller isn't about throwing a bunch of random cool looking enemies at you because HOLY CRAP! It's about a very subtle attention to pacing. The enemies at the start and at the end of Painkiller are a carefully planned spectrum. You get a bunch of easy fights, a slightly niftier new enemy, a bunch of easy fights, a newer niftier enemy, easy fights.... you get to a point that it all seems tired but if you look back, its a spiral staircase slowly building you up to a point that you're a god compared to the trash you started the game fighting. But at the same time you were dazzled by baubles strung along to distract you.

Awesome levels in terms of space (at the time in the early 00's it was pretty neat-o) and in terms of detail (Get absorbed into the game and tell me you haven't visited Limbo recently), Sounds are a bit meh at times and ""That's cool"" at others. Nothing stands out. Overall graphics were good for the time and, unless you really stop to critque them, they haven't faded much. The ambient and battle musics transition well, you're kept in the realm of ""what's happening now."" Blended together you get a game that Epic Games rightly caught wind of. People May Fly joins Epic Games, some ""Cool 'bro"" happens then we wind up with BULLETSTORM!!! And if you loved Painkiller, admit it, you LOVED Bulletstorm.

Either way: Cool game bro!",True,106
3200,"Painkiller is a wonderful throwback to older first-person shooters where the purpose was to run into the midst of enemies and kill them while dodging their fire, instead of hiding behind cover and popping out to take pot shots occasionally. Additionally, it has quite possibly the widest variety and sheer scope of weapons available in first person shooters, including a weapon which fires large sharpened wooden staves, and one which shoots shirukens and lightning, just to give you a taste.

While the sequels do not quite stand up to the original, this original game is simply great and will completely whet the appetite of someone who's looking for a more pure run and gun experience than modern shooters provide.",True,94

3200,"Heyyo, an homeage to classic FPS games, Painkiller Black Edition sports the original Painkiller with expansions. This is one badass game with the 2foot long wooden steak launcher and the gun that shoots shuriken and lighting bolts... the most badass gun in fps history.",True,39
3220,"I think this game is not bad if you play it as a RPG. 
If you're looking for a space simulation game, don't buy this. 
This is NOT a good simulation game. 
However, you can just play it like Mass Effect. 
Doing quests, shooting bad guys, selling loots, and upgrading your ship. 
You can feel totaly free to playing in this game (although some people are too free to understanding how to play it).

Pros:
Free style RPG
High C/P value (it's very cheap)
Easy controlable - it's not simulation game, you don't neet to press a lot of key for just a simple action (such as yaw or U turn)

Cons:
Bad trading design - I need to remember all item prices by myself?!
Bad documentation - and it cause some player hard to know how to play, and they may think this game is trash
No friendly quest list (for reminding)",True,57
3220,I really enjoyed playing this game. Finally played it to the ending of the story line. The shooting is fun in this game but It doesnt keep me coming back to it like X3 A-Prelude does. Still I recommend it to any space shooting fans out there. To me it is a better game than what the critics have rated it.,True,33
3220,"Boring. It takes too much time to defeat a single enemy ship and the resources they give its so little that the player must spend hours killing enemies to buy one upgrade. Very tedious and poorly balanced.

UPDATE:
Some tips i wish i had known at the beginning:
- Avoid the ""Destroy Subject"" missions at the beggining. Focus on ""activate satellite"" missions and increasing the diplomacy with other races (every mission completed gives 3% of diplomacy to a chosen faction)
- The big containers near the space station are warehouses. If you dock in there you can drop your loot from your inventory. Useful to save narcotics and resources.
- Focus on mining, and get the upgrades. If you max out a stat, you can sell the upgrade for lots of money to a space station latter in the game.
- press ""F"" to target an enemy and show him on the screen. The screen shows the level of the ship and the type of shield and armor it uses. Avoid confrontation against higher levels.
- Try to not attack anything until you get the sniping tool. Then, you can change to sniping fire mode and destroy your enemies easier than using other fire modes. (easier to aim and it does more damage)

The game suffers from lack of information about basic controls. If you get pass the dificulty curve its  enjoyable.",True,32
3220,"""I'd like a buy a space sim with little to no explanation or tutorial.""

""And while I'm at it, is it possible that said game has dialogue that appears to be written and performed by the cast of The Room?""

""I truly enjoy pegging away at space pirates with all the efficacy of a pea shooter bringing down a Sherman Tank.""

If you've found yourself saying any of the previous statements, I've got good news...",False,27
3220,"The game is similar to Freelancer and the old Privateer. Yes there is a learning curve. Best to just get the online manual and look it over like we used to before they put tutorials in games. Once you get the hang of the controls (Enter to Dock or interact with Satellites), it plays quite smooth. Yes it is hard in the beginning to fight and win against multiple targets, but that is what makes it challenging. You have to have skill to win battles. I suggest you use ""match target speed"" (Page Down) once you lock on a target and lead him. There is a blue mark that does the work for you. As soon as you can, do some mining and get the materials to make all of the upgrades. Once you have level 1 upgrades on everything you are pretty much ready to venture out further. Yes you will put a bit of time into mining and building the various upgrades. Its a slow progression, but it feels like you have accomplished something. If you are not into a challenge and need to be spoon fed with tutorials and have things on easy mode, this game is not for you.",True,24
3220,See [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/3220/discussions/0/846957263123064484/]this[/url] thread in the discussion forums for details.,True,20
3220,"It's my fault.  I hit ""buy"" before I realized this is a JoWood game.  JoWood: Making subpar ripoffs for years.  The game looks like crap.  The controls are ridiculous.  There is a constant haze on the screen, not sure what that is.  The voice acting is a joke.  Avoid this game like genital warts.",False,20
3220,"This game is deceptive. Looks good, seems to have some fair depth, but the reality is that it's straight-up awful. 

Starting off, following the usual (cheesy) story introduction, you're dumped in the middle of a fight, with only the basic nav controls explained. No interactive tutorial, no chance to get used to the controls and UI. Just dumped in a fight and left to figure out every single relevant interaction in 5 seconds flat. Then, if you survive that (""if"")... well, don't expect much else. There's a marker to pick up a mission, but that's it. You're on your own! I'm not one to advocate for games holding your hand every step of the way, but this is just masking poor design under the guise of ""freedom"". Honestly though, I couldn't stomach getting any further anyway, because...

...the UI is pretty much unforgivable. The basic information displays are largely ignored - absolute velocity for starters. When in space, with little visual reference, this is pretty much mandatory. I also noticed that the primary-fire lasers are limited by some kind of refilling capacitor (standard in games like these), but there is no indication of that on-screen; you're again left guessing. The few details that are visible are done so in a poor slap-dash manner, with irrelevant items instead given more prominent placement. For example, the comms screen, which shows static 98% of the time (and pre-animated heads on occasion), is given marked priority over more vital engine read-outs (the few that exist anyway)

It's not just visual interaction that suffers, but controls too. By default, primary-fire actually launches your secondary missiles as well, despite there being a separate missile-fire key. So, if you don't want every shot of your lasers to near-instantly waste your missile stocks, you have to... completely unmount your current missiles. Hope you don't want them in a hurry during a fight!

This game could have more depth than X3 and it wouldn't matter. The interaction is so poor that it doesn't take long before you're left mashing Alt-F4 in frustration.",False,18
3220,Great Little game for what i played some indepth features i love the feel of exploring these space games. big fan of freelancer this comes close although combat feels little sluggish at times still a good game to play especially for less than a fiver!,True,16
3220,"Long-suffering space simulator fans will take what they can get.  This game has appalling voice acting and what I've experienced of the story is quite weak.  There are some nice graphic and gameplay elements, but older gamers who fondly remember Elite, Privateer and Freelancer won't find the game they've been waiting for here.  If you're desperate, Space Force rogue Universe is a half-decent alternative to X3.",False,14
3230,"This game is worth a few bucks now just to see the nice art style and checkout living ships and the out there space opera story line.  Sadly the game has issues.  The latest version on Steam works fine for me on Win 10 with no additinal effort, the missing file directory thing seems to have been fixed.  

Playing it for fun however is severly hampered by two things:  Having to micro-mouse in order to use the best weapons (no hotkeys for them) and no player initiated saves.  

Cool to checkout, but not something I want to actually play.",True,1
3230,"Tells me my graphics card is unsupported and none of the fixes suggested by anybody works. Guess I'll just have to get a refund.

A real shame, because it looks rad and has an interesting premise.",False,1
3260,"I had some framerate issues even with the D3D fix recommended by the guides (Windows 10 OS). May have had something to do with my graphics card, so I tried it on one of my older computers with a Linux OS, which amazingly already had wine/proton support, game ran well after that. One of those unique situations where Linux gaming worked better for me than Windows. Can't say much for certain based on my experience, but you may have problems if you are running anything past Windows XP with some fancy graphics card.

The puzzles are great and mostly unique, though it feels that some of them are not quite nailed down enough to have a definite solution, so you may have to try a few permutations before getting it right. I guess that makes you a bit of a safecracker in that regard.

Overall enjoyed myself in spite of the technical difficulties. It's an old gem of a game that you might find more challenging than most escape room experiences.",True,1
3270,"Before I get too far, I played about 12-13 hours of this game, despite Steam saying I played only 0.6 hours. Reason for the hour count being low was because I used the Mod called ""PowerMad"" which created a different launching Executable. Yeah I cheated I dont care, it was the only way to bare through the problem and instability of this game.

Been a long time fan of Painkiller / Painkiller Black Edition. A long while ago I went on a whim to buy all the games again when they went on Steam Sale. The first Painkiller was amazing in terms of its released time, using the revamped Havok Physics Engine even though it was still unrefined.

Now we come to the sequels... Painkiller Overdose. If you plan on playing this, good luck. I would suggest searching in Google ""Painkiller PowerMad"". It does come as an EXE file, which its actually a mod that hooks into the game as a Launcher for the game. Unlocks Cheats for all difficulties, Tarot Cards, adds back cut commands, etc. It will save you some of the headache from playing this game. 

At the time of release it was good to have more Painkiller, another story, but it was so unrefined and all over the place. Modern systems that are now able to perform natively above 60fps, particularly anything over 120fps will break the game. I died close to about 30 times in the first 2 minutes of the 1st level because of the physics and the broken difficulty ramp of the enemies. Even on Daydream (easy) the enemies will 2-shot on a graze. The physics damage from Fire, Heat Waves from Lava will break and multiply their damage exponentially.

The Weapons are very unbalanced and the damage they do is generally way too little, like the Bone Shotgun can take up to 5 shots to kill a basic entry level enemy. The best weapon in the game is the Blade Cube, spam r-click all day on Sub-Boss and Boss level enemies and just kill most in seconds.

Story starts off well, falls off right when you finish the first Chapter, and the end is beyond underwhelming.

Audio and Sounds, decent sound track, not awesome, just decent. Then you have the Voice bits, which are so repetitive cycling through 5 of the same voicelines constantly... 'mmm tastes like chicken' or 'Kiss my shiny Angel xxx'... etc. 

Level designs are Okay, a couple repeats from the previous Painkiller. Just some bad design choices where I was able to break out of the boundaries multiple times and explore the maps which have a bunch of unused and unpolished assets, but nothing notable.

The enemies are recolored/textured and reused messes, some are resized. Very few are original to this version. The Final boss fight... picture Michael from the Office biting down on his lower lip in a painfully cringe manner. Its that bad.

3340,"I actually like the core gameplay of Astropop, the problem has more to do with the fact that it has been utterly abandoned by PopCap and EA.

Problem 1)  Game will not save - That's right, for a game that is based on progressive unlocks, it will not save.  Reading through support forum notes I think this may be because I am running a Windows 10 machine.  But if that's the case then it's a good reason to warn people away.

Problem 2)  Game runs extremely low resolution - It doesn't support modern graphics methods, won't recognize that I have a graphics card more than capable of it's ""high end"" settings, and has no ability to change resolution for a widescreen monitor.

Otherwise it's a fun brick breaking game.  I just wish it would get fixed so it's playable again.",False,26
3340,"AstroPop Deluxe is a simple puzzle game, consisting of rearranging blocks to create four-of-a-kind (or more) matches.  The premise is simple enough, and gameplay is just as simple.  Where it really gets tricky is when you have diferent types of colorless blocks that can't be removed the way all of the other blocks are removed from play.  This requires you to work around them, use special power blocks, and a special ability that allows you to blast blocks.  The over all puzzle aspect of the game is simple, but the speed of the game is what really makes it tricky.

If you are more interested in speed puzzles, rather than elaborate and exotic ideas, this is definitely a game to play in small doses.  A great, simple puzzle game for all ages.  Don't forget to try the demo!",True,23

I really enjoyed this game back in the old day but ... the version on Steam is just absolute trash.

- When you create a profile and ""save"" and then quit the game and go back in guess what your profile isn't there
- Secondly, all buttons can't be picked up by my cursor, like my cursor is physically over the button but the button doesn't react ... sigh 
- No resolution support, you or play windowed 800 x 600 or fullscreen (800 x 600)

So yeah, no resolution control (not even through a secondary launcher which is what a lot of older games do when ""porting"" to steam and later versions of windows), no bloody saving and horrible GUI interactivity.

In this case, it was a bit different than I expected. When I saw the first screenshots, I thought that it would be deflecting a ball or sphere towards the gems to make them disappear. Instead, however, you'll have to sort the gems to make them disappear. Groups of four or more can vanish. And it will just grow more complicated from there.

3390,"Ah, Feeding Frenzy 2! This game takes me back to a simpler time, a time when I spent hours sitting in front of my computer, lost in the colorful and addictive world of underwater predators.

Feeding Frenzy 2 was one of those games that I could just never get enough of. The premise was simple: you start off as a small fish, and your goal is to eat your way up the food chain, avoiding bigger and more dangerous predators along the way. But what really made this game special was the way it combined fast-paced action with colorful graphics and catchy music. 

I remember spending hours trying to beat my high score, frantically dodging barracudas and anglerfish as I gobbled up smaller fish and power-ups. And when I finally made it to the end of a level, the thrill of becoming a bigger and more powerful predator was unbeatable.

But what really made Feeding Frenzy 2 so special was the nostalgia it brings me. Every time I play it, I'm transported back to a time when life was simpler, and all I had to worry about was getting to the next level of the game. It's a reminder of the joy and innocence of childhood, and a game that I will always treasure for the memories it holds.

So if you're looking for a fun and nostalgic trip down memory lane, I highly recommend giving Feeding Frenzy 2 a try. It's a classic game that has stood the test of time and continues to bring joy to players of all ages.",True,3

3470,"Normally, games built around a single mechanic aren't very good.  Generally the designers run out of fresh ways to abuse the concept about an hour into the game, and as a gamer we're left with 10 more hours of rehash, possibly with a timer thrown in for artificial difficult.

Bookworm Adventures, on the other hand, is amazing.  It helps, certainly, that the central mechanic (boggle) is so much fun, but Popcap managed to stretch it in ways that would make 10 tons of silly putty jealous.  By occasionally adding simple embellishments, the designers open up tremendous new gameplay opportunities.  The main quest can take about 20 hours, but the gameplay always seems fresh.

It helps too that doing well in this game makes you feel smart.  This is a challenging game, especially later on, and it forces you to dig deeper and deeper into your vocabulary well.  Despite the challenge, however, the game rather cleverly helps you when you're struggling.  For every enemy you defeat, you gain experience and levels, which grant stat boosts.  You keep these levels even when you die.  If you're in a particularly tough spot, if you persevere, you'll eventually get through thanks to better levels and your own improvement.

Finally, this is a charming, funny game.  The premise is completely ridiculous, but Popcap decided to play it straight and it works really well.  Now, due to industry regulations, I am required to end this review of Bookworm Adventures with the following phrase: Sometimes the pen really is mightier than the sword.",True,26

3470,"Most think PopCap and go, ""Oh, stupid little casual games.""  Well, some are, but some aren't.  

Bookworm Adventure Deluxe is the result of mixing a word game and a turn-based RPG.  Don't confuse this with the original Bookworm, which was a word-based puzzle game only.

You attack in turns and the more complex the word you spelled, the greater damage it potentially does to the enemy.  Gem-based word tiles (a green gem word tile means it heals you, whereas a red game word tile sets the enemy on fire) can alter your attacks as well.  Potions are simple: one type heals you, one cures you (takes away all negative effects) and the other enhances your attack.

You can gain items which enhance your offensive, defensive or gem/potion collecting abilities.  Different enemies are weak or resistant to various attacks and effects and others can poison you, freeze you, set you on fire and do a whole lot more.

The story is broken into three chapters based on different mythologies (Greek, Arabian, and Eastern European) which add flavor to what could be otherwise be a game full of boring enemies.  Some of the enemies are really strange, too, but that's part of the game's humor.

All in all, I'd recommend getting this (preferably on a Steam sale) if you like puzzle games or RPGs at all.  The second game isn't as good, so just get this one.",True,9

3470,Yeah... I guess I play it from time to time.,True,5
3470,"A classic game from the Popcap golden years. It's a very simple game, so I will only really have two things to say about it:

POSITIVE:

The word-puzzle gameplay is very fun. Adventures is a lot different from the original bookworm where you could only link letts that were horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. Adventures gives you a smaller pool of letters in a Boggle-like square, but whenever you click on a letter to use it, it is removed from the board and ""placed on the table"". You can use any letters that were directly horizontal, vertical, or diagonal to that letter, yes, but you can also use any letter with an exposed side (i.e. from having an adjacent letter removed). This small tweak gives you A LOT more flexibility, and can sometimes allow you to create colossal words as big as ""acquiescence"" if you are super skilled and observant.

The RPG elements add some fun flavor to the word game, but they are extremely light. You get to unlock potions and various equips for Bookworm to help him go head to head with monsters in his lexicographical battles.

NEGATIVE:

While the attack, defense, potions, equips, status effects, etc of an RPG game make a mostly welcome appearance in bookworm adventures, there is one place where the RPG mechanics really break the entire experience, and that is simply the XP system. In a normal RPG, if you came up against an enemy that was too strong for you, you could avoid it or run away from it and practice on weaker enemies until you were ready.

Well, bookworm doesn't let you control your pace. Instead, it pushes you forward, forward, forward to the next strongest monster, and the next, and the next. There is no way for you to stop and grind some extra XP. You just have to keep on going. This ultimately results in you getting pushed into monsters that are OBVIOUSLY way too strong for you and there is zero chance of you defeating it. Or even if you somehow pull off a miracle victory, the very next monster will be EVEN STRONGER, and so there really is nothing you can do.

What this means is that you will reach a point where the game essentially forces you to die so that an NPC named Moxie will come along and help you by offering you mini-games to play to earn heal and buff potions. So grinding to get more XP and become stronger in Bookworm Adventures amounts to killing 2 or 3 monsters, then letting the 4th one kill you on purpose to summon Moxie, earn some bonus potions, then repeat that death cycle 3 or 4 more times. You absolutely cannot grind extra XP to become stronger without intentionally committing suicide. (This becomes more and more the case as you get further into the game.) My suspicion is that it was done this way to force player to use Moxie, but it's hard to tell. At any rate, it is not ideal at all.

I recommend playing it for the word game and MOST of the RPG elements.

However, I don't recommend it because having death forced upon you (note: not just very difficult, but literally you must die to progress) and then being treated like ""looks like you need some help there"" does not a good RPG make. It adds an element of patronizing futility to the game that just does not feel good. It's too bad that such a small thing increasingly weighs down an otherwise excellent word game.",False,5

3480,"Ah, Peggle Deluxe, the game that stole my heart and countless hours of my life. As I sit here, remembering all the times I spent aiming my little ball and watching it bounce around the screen, I can't help but feel a sense of nostalgia for this classic game.

For those who haven't had the pleasure of playing Peggle Deluxe, let me give you a quick rundown. The game is essentially a cross between pinball and pachinko, with the goal being to hit all the orange pegs on the screen before running out of balls. But, as you progress through the levels, things get more and more complicated, with special power-ups, obstacles, and even boss battles.

What I loved most about this game was its simplicity. Anyone could pick it up and start playing, but it had just enough depth and strategy to keep you coming back for more. And, let's be real, there's nothing quite as satisfying as hitting that last orange peg and watching the screen explode in a shower of fireworks and confetti.

But, Peggle Deluxe wasn't just a fun game, it was a work of art. The bright and colorful graphics, whimsical sound effects, and catchy music all combined to create a truly magical experience. I can still hear the sound of the ball bouncing off the pegs and the cheers of the Peggle Masters as I cleared each level.

The game's various Peggle Masters were also a highlight for me. Each one had their own unique personality and special power, from the zen-like Bjorn to the explosive Jimmy Lightning. I felt like I was getting to know them as I played, and it added an extra layer of enjoyment to the game.

And, of course, who could forget about the iconic ""Ode to Joy"" that played whenever you hit the last orange peg? It's a small detail, but it was a perfect way to cap off each level and give players a sense of accomplishment.

In conclusion, Peggle Deluxe will always hold a special place in my heart. It's a game that's easy to pick up and play, but hard to put down. Its charming graphics, catchy music, and addictive gameplay make it a true masterpiece of the casual gaming world. So, if you're feeling a little nostalgic or just want to experience the joy of hitting orange pegs one more time, fire up Peggle Deluxe and let the good times roll.",True,4

3490,"Venice is a puzzle game from casual game company PopCap.  While the company is very familiar to many people, this game is not.  It's a hidden gem on the PC platform, and it has a harsh difficulty curve.

The game centers around Venice, Italy sinking into the waves, and it's up to you, as a random small-ish gondola, to save the treasures of Venice before all is lost.  It's a better story than Bejeweled, but not exactly AAA writing.  But, for what it needs to do, it sets the game up perfectly.

If you've ever played Luxor or Zuma, the game controls essentially like that.  Your objective is to match all of the shapes without letting any fall into the water below.  This is where the game can and will screw you over multiple times, by placing nearly impossible trick shots that rely on pin-point timing and accuracy.  It can get frustrating, but you feel a good sense of accomplishment after completing the level.

The music is up to PopCap standards, as it fits the gameplay very well, and adds to the atmosphere.  The visuals do the job, but show their age.  Not too much to the point of looking bad, but enough to notice.  I have a reoccuring problem with many of PopCap's games.  It doesn't detect that my graphics card supports hardware acceleration, even though it does.  I'm sporting an AMD Radeon HD 8240, and my old iBook G4 from 2005 supports hardware acceleration.  I don't get it, but the game looks nice even without accelerated graphics.

I like that this game will allow you to reach the end of the ""journey"" by playing it safe. You can take your time, take only the safest of shots, and forego bonuses if you just want to make it through without replaying. Alternatively, you can also be a hotshot speed player and rack up a great score through your innate understanding of the physics of throwing vases. Skilled players will probably enjoy pursuing a combo-heavy high score and will get more play hours out of the game by replaying. Less skilled players will probably just be happy to reach the end.

Mystery P.I. is a very old-school pure hidden object game even for its original release date. If you can still enjoy these low-resolution, overcrowded HOGs, then you can find plenty of playtime for your money.

[h1]Long version:[/h1]
Mystery P.I.: The Lottery Ticket was definitely a latecomer to the classic hidden object game scene, because it feels like a HOG from 2005, not 2007. Gameplay is purely hidden object scenes, where we continuously repeat the same 20 screens with a gradually tighter time limit.

The challenge rating matches its age, with crowded scenes that cram over 100 items into an 800×600 playing area. While it never resorts to cheap tricks, it reuses the same few objects on too many of the scenes, resulting in a mediocre experience.

The game tries to motivate players with an unlockable endless mode and a scoring system that favours finding items in quick succession, but these touches can only make gameplay a little less numbingly repetitive for modern audiences.",True,17
3500,"This review was first published elsewhere in 2010. I've edited it.

Grandma Rose is a lucky and unlucky woman. She won the big lottery which means she's now very rich but before touching her money, she needs her ticket... And she thinks she lost it. So you're sent by your agency to find it within 12 hours... You're not an ordinary P.I., you're the Mysterious P.I..

Basically, there is nothing extraordinary in the storyline and it's just a background for the game: you're never interacting with the town citizen, you're just visiting places. So, you can't really say if the game is parody, comedy, drama, thriller, etc.. And I can really say that the end is providing a total different answer I've imagined. Was it a good surprise? Yes and no. Yes because of my imagination and no because it's not really an end I love generally.

Mysterious P.I. was a good title but behind, there is no real story and no real ID on who he or she is and even if it's bothering me at some levels, in the end, you're the Mysterious P.I.. It's up to you to give him/her a name, to decide if his badge will show a fingerprint, a male or a female.

Mystery P.I. is nothing else than an HoG with minigames at the end of each level. However, you have two modes: Normal and Unlimited Search.

The Normal Mode is self-explanatory: it's the story mentioned above. Each level is divided in different scenes. The much you advance, the more scenes you'll get to visit. Your goal is to find a list of given items. When you clear a level (in other words, when you have cleared all scenes), a minigame is appearing. It will be always variants of ""find the pair"", for example, find a pair of the same object but one is depicted in an ancient state and the other in his actual state. You receive a piece of puzzle that would be useful at the end of the game. Each level is timed, which means that all scenes must be visited before the clock shows 00.00.

You should know about the score because it's tied to your rank. I explain: you can climb up a ladder of ranks by scoring points. Each object found is worth of 5000 points. If you're being fast to find them in row, you have a bonus (first is 2500, second is 3500, etc..). An hidden key is also worth of 10 000 points. And if you're clearing the level of all objects (instead of choosing to solve the puzzle when you have between two and four items still in the scenes), you can score a 25 000 bonus points for a perfect investigation. If the numbers are different (without key and perfect investigation), this schema is applying also to the ending puzzle.

And what about the Unlimited Search? Every location visited during the normal story is open and you have still to clear them but here, it's about all the objects.

Graphics are correct: the map itself is clear, the HUD is in my favorite color (blue) and the scenes are well-drawn. Perhaps some scenes are invaded by a lot of objects, like in the Firemen Station, where some objects are difficult to spot because you're viewing a sort of blur but the graphics are at least representing the level you're playing.

The soundtrack is fitting to the game but unfortunately, it's always the same track which is played. As it's not something weird, you're not really paying attention to it.

Also, for some of you, as it's not really an adventure game, you will probably be bored rapidly.

Regarding all these elements, Mystery P.I. can be a little deceiving at the end: a classic gameplay, only one track as soundtrack, no real story behind (no cutscene for example) and perhaps a little too long. But the game is redeeming itself with an unlimited mode, with the fact that you really want to find the lottery ticket because you're curious to know where it is and the fact that the game is at a medium difficulty (you don't have very small objects at least).

I recommend to play it for the afficionados, just because after that, Vegas Heist will improve, in terms of minigames mainly.",True,10
3500,"It's important to understand what you're buying when you're getting this game.

This is one of the earlier hidden object games in the genre, which has since evolved into more intricate games with plot, inventory, and variety.  It's very important to know that this is almost EXCLUSIVELY hidden object scenes, and very detailed ones (in that these scenes are packed edge to edge with objects), with only a small matching minigame in between levels and one minigame at the end.

If the hidden object aspect of more recent (and more complex) games appeals to you a lot, you may enjoy this game.  If you're actually looking for plot, puzzles, inventory management, and a cast of characters, you probably want to avoid it.

It is an older game and graphically it didn't age well; some objects can be blurry or pixelly and hard to make out.  For the most part, however, the game is perfectly playable and the hint button can be used for anything that's hiding too successfully.  The scenes can get repetitive and it's not really a ""play it all through in one sitting"" sort of game; I usually would play a level, or a few scenes from a level, at a time as a time-killer.

This is a timed game.  However, on each level I had ample time to find all of the objects in all of the locations and usually ended the level with at least 20 minutes left on the timer (and usually more).  The timed aspect didn't seem to be much of a challenge.

All things considered, despite the sometimes-unclear objects and the repetition of scenes, this is a reasonably-priced time killer that is worth the money for six hours of total gameplay.",True,7
3500,"Alright, this is the second of the Mystery P.I. games I completely finished, and the third game of this kind I played through. Contrary to the ""Lost in Los Angeles"" game, ""The Lottery Ticket"" offers a slightly faster, and more difficult gameplay. While there are no instances when the object to look for is described instead of directly named, there is no option for relaxed gameplay, forcing the player to properly manage time they spend on each site.

Adding to that, I found that compared to ""Lost in Los Angeles"", some objects blended much more into the background, making it hard to find them, and required me to use the ""hint"" option more often.

Since ""The Lottery Ticket"" was made earlier than ""Lost in Los Angeles"", I suppose that ""The Lottery Ticket"" still lacked some of the options given by the later games. I think it's quite good that the game gives you limited time only to find everything.

Overall, I still wouldn't recommend this game really. While it did take me more time than ""Lost in Los Angeles"", it still suffers from the same problems as ""Lost in Los Angeles"" and ""Escape Rosecliff Island"", with extremely repetitive gameplay and a requirement to be patient and tenacious to complete the game.

However, since I acquired it in a bundle, it was quite worth it. I'd recommend buying in a bundle and/or when the price is reduced.

I still have two more Mystery P.I. games to complete from the bundle, and will do so in the next weeks. As for the previous two, I will write reviews upon completion.",False,6
3500,"This may have been one of the earlier Mystery P.I. games before they perfected the game in the series.  I am a devout Mystery P.I. fan--but I'm afraid this one disappointed me.  The puzzles are all the same and tedious.  The artwork is still wonderful and there is one redeeming quality in all this---once you unlock the unlimited HOG  play feature  you can point and click to your heart's content.  So now that you are prepared, I'd say go ahead and purchase this.  You'll have it for the long haul.",False,4
3500,"Play this whenever you are in the mood for a real proper HOG. 

Sure, it has neither story cutscenes or puzzles unlike current HOGs/HOPAs.

But what it does have are solid HOG scenes, think Where's Wally. Sometimes, old school is still the best.",True,3
3500,"This is an old-school hidden object game, meaning that it's a collection of repeated scenes with random assortment of objects and a very rudimentary story. These games are meant to play as a casual relaxing experience, and this is where this game fails, since it imposes a time limit (which is very easy to circumvent with screenshots, etc, so it's annoying and ultimately meaningless). Using time limits is a game design failure in my book -- I don't play games to have another deadline-related stress (I've got work for that), so this game gets a No from me. 

PS. BTW, if you happen to click through all items on a level too fast, you might get stuck without ability to invoke the mini-game that gets you another puzzle peace, and there's no solution for this. Sucks if you completed almost the whole game already (which happened to me).",False,1
3500,"There is very little story, no voice acting, and no poorly animated people, just hidden object puzzles.  I found this to be a blessing!  At first, the reuse of the same scenes with different search lists was fine, and in fact, if the game had stopped with 15 rounds instead of 20, I think I would have recommended this game.  However, after 20 rounds, each revisit to the same tired scenes filled with me with dread.  Add in that the scenes are not all that great to look at it (this is an older game), and I ended up hating this game.  Only stubbornness drove me on to the end.  A much better game of this ilk is the Season of Mystery:  The Cherry Blossom Murders.",False,0

3510,"I'm giving a thumbs-up but this game is definitely not for everyone. There isn't a story and even though the music fits the game, it's the same few scores over and over. Amazing Adventures: The Lost Tomb is for those looking for a challenging hidden object experience. They really cram a ton of items into each scene and many are well hidden. I guess they don't call it hidden object game for nothing. :p  So the game is basically just many many HO scenes with puzzles inbetween each one. Jigsaw, Memory Tiles, and Spot the Differences. The game gives you 20 ""missions"" and each one is an ever increasing number of said HOs and puzzles. At the end of a mission, you'll get a fact about Egypt and part of a manuscript. I'm assuming you assemble the manuscript at the end of the game. I haven't got there yet. I still have 10 missions to go and I have a feeling it's going to take awhile. One thing about The Lost Tomb that I REALLY like is the bonus you get if you find a scarab in each of the 21 HO scenes. You'll then be able to play each scene and find EVERY item. (When you find an item on the list, a new one will pop into its place). There is a huge satisfaction in completely clearing a scene. I wish other HO games had this feature. So in closing, only buy this if you're up for a challenge, don't mind the lack of a story, and can deal with some repetition. It's a good game for HO fans who need a break between other things. :)",True,36

3510,"If you like hidden object puzzled and don't want to be bothered by a story, this is the game for you.

If you like some variation in your HOGs, this is not the game for you. All locations are used and reused and then used some more. 

If I recommend the game? Suuuuuure. But only to fans of the genre - and if you get it for cheap. I don't think it's worth its current price of 4.99€ unless you really *really* like mindless HOGs.",True,5
3510,"Best played with an alarm clock at your side. A game which will bore you to death with repetitious HOG. 

Originally developed by Spin Top which was later acquired by POPCAP. The HOG scenes are all badly discernible hand drawn areas which look like landscapes where space junk has fallen from the skies and just littered the place. Amongst all the red herrings you must find the ones that the game dictates in your list. Once all those have been completed you get treated to a puzzle in the form of spot the difference/pairs/jigsaw etc. Once that is done you are required to repeat another HOG probably one you have already done before. This just goes on and on, until you eventually reach level 20 where you will be given some type of Hidden Object Sensei title which you can now put on your useless gaming resume. 

Each level you raise up you get an artefact and a small entry journal about an Egyptian fact which you would have probably learnt back at pre-school. At the end you are required to solve a door opening Puzzle and you get rewarded with the fact that you have finished the game. There is a further option to find scarabs hidden in the various levels which will unlock another mode where you can clear every hidden object scene completely for all those clean freaks out there.

I never thought that something I do every day would be made into a game let alone be considered fun. Seriously every morning I wake up, i put on some music and need to look around my littered blast zone bedroom for 'Keys' 'wallet' 'hungry cat' 'chocolate muffin' 'underpants' and never had I stopped and thought about turning it into a game and making money from it. Boy am I missing out...

› Some of the items have silly names. [scroll in vase, makeup item, ex-caterpillars, ect...]
› It's very repetitive.

› No difficulty settings.

› The game does not include any community items.

[b]Do I recommend this game?[/b]
If you are after a simple seek and find game with a few extra puzzles popped in this is for you but I have played better. If you are after a story driven hidden object game this is not what you are looking for you may want to look elsewhere. I personally did not enjoy this game as there are better ones out there, but if this is something for you to play casually just to kill a bit of time you will probably enjoy how easy it is to play.",False,3
3510,"[h1]This game is pretty much like the I-Spy books. There's random objects cluttered on a still background image, and they ask you to find 10 of the items by clicking on them.
The items stay the same place in every map/location but everytime you replay it they ask you for different things.
You're given a 12-15 minute time limit on each run, randomly clicking 4+ times gives you a point/score penalty.
You get a score multiplyer by clicking the objects you're looking for sequentially, so taking the time to observe multiple targets rather than clicking on everyone you find is key if you want more points.
Although you can pause the game which doesn't block the image so you can continue search for the items without worrying about the timer.
There's a Hint button as well, which points out a general location where an item you haven't found is, which costs $4,000, while every item you find (on it's own) gives you $2,000 so you don't loose too much.
Sometimes a hint is really needed when the item it asks for like 33 RPM really means a vynyl recond, like 33, okay but why the RPM that confused me? As well and other items they vaguely put up that has mutiple meanings for.

There's also different puzzle solving than the I-Spy kind, like a match game, a Spot-The-Difference game, and a puzzle piece game which adds to a good change.

There's a golden scarab per stage and if you find all 21, then beat the game, you can replay any mission without having a time limit.
But beating the game requires you to play the SAME damn maps at least 10 times over, which gets really repetitive... so I ended up quitting after spending the amount of time I did on it and only getting 8/20 ""stages"" done although I played around 35 ""levels"".

I would highly reccomend this game if you love the I-Spy books, and it's great for when you're bored and have nothing else to do!

_____________

This is part of a series of hidden object (HO) games developed by [url=http://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=SpinTop%20Games]SpinTop Games[/url] and published by [url=http://store.steampowered.com/search/?publisher=PopCap%20Games,%20Inc.]PopCap Games[/url] between 2007-2009. To date they are my favourite of the genre.

Unlike more modern HO games where the items are often practically jumping out at you, here they are masterfully blended and conspicuous (sometimes even a little too much so.) The whole scene looks practically painted.

Each stage ends with a varied puzzle (crosswords, rotating tiles, spot the difference) that offers a little break and introduced the next level. And each level ends with a small informative blurb that I assume nobody will read, but it adds a bit of substance.

More modern HO games try to amp it up with plot and animations and a story and voice acting and what not, usually with bad results, because at the end of the day, it's a cheesy casual game and reaching for more just makes it awkward.
But this series focuses efforts on the mechanics of HO gameplay, and it shows in how well the scenes are made.

Shame about that low resolution though.",True,25
3530,"I love hidden object find-it games, but this series by Popcap is terrible. 
Popcap have their fair share of fun games, but these are definitely not up there. The music for me is just irritating. It’s painful to listen to, it’s very repetitive and all sounds the same. It’s all in a low tone, and honesty I have to say it barely passes for music. Nor background ambience for that matter. It’s a horrible mixture of both I suppose. I turnt all the settings down so I don’t have to listen to it, but no audio at all makes it even more boring than it already is, so I played my own music in the background. Just to try and make the game a tad bit more bearable. 
The gameplay is fairly repetitive, you play the same 5 scenes over and over and over again, and it feels as if it goes on forever. To complete, it’s way too long. Or at least felt that way. It just felt like a chore to complete. I made myself finish it because usually I want to finish games I’ve started before I can move on.(anyone that knows me will know my illogical OCD-tendencies when it comes to my steam library).
Like most games, it felt so good to finish, but not in a satisfying way. Where you finish, reflect on the game and feel good about it. In a way that just made me so happy that I would never have to go near this game ever again.
If you enjoy hidden object games, don't buy these. There are much better ones you can buy. The ""Midnight Mysteries"" and “Samantha Swift” series were good in my opinion. I played through them quite easily. They actually have a story and is a lot more engaging. The time it took me to complete those series of games, was probably the same amount of time I spent dragging myself through this game.",False,13

3530,"Dear Gods, why did I buy the Popcap Bundle? WHY?

*ahem*

Let's do this.

This game is the 6th hidden object game I have played. Like the Mystery P.I. games that I have played and reviewed, this game was produced by Spintop and published via Popcap. The objects hidden in the scenes are almost all the same, and there are only a very few which would be different.

The flavor of story accompanying this game is finding a stone tablet, which will lead to the World Gem (which looks like a ginormous refined diamond big enough to be likened to the size of a toddler). Well. That's all of a story.

I have played through the main game and the endless seeking mode for hidden objects, like I did in Escape Rosecliff Island and the four Mystery P.I. games I have played. Good Gods did that take some time.

Not recommended unless you're a junkie for hidden object games and have the necessary patience and tenacity to find everything. 

...and there will be another Amazing Adventures game waiting for me. But this will be reviewed in due time.",False,3
3530,"when you have that ""there's too much going on for me to concentrate"" feeling, this one is a fine time waster. was definitely worth a play through.",True,3
3530,"Simple idea... do lots of hidden object scenes quickly.    No big story, no big adventure.  The ""Around the World"" thing is really nothing more than a simple theme to create a reason for having hidden object puzzles in a variety of international locations.  This is essentially the same as the Mystery PI series from Spintop.  Just fun, if you want to do one hidden object puzzle after another.  Highly recommend for hidden object fans.",True,2
3530,"Someone said it best, ""It made me keep nodding off!""

I wholeheartedly concur, couldn't play this more than a few minutes and I was off in LALA land with the faeries. Rest assured if you suffer with insomnia this little beauty will put you in a deep sleep within half hour tops. I aren’t kidding. I really tested this. I tried everything to combat its narcolepsy effects from toothpicks under my eyelids, to black coffee straight. Nothing and I mean nothing stopped it from making me suddenly becoming lethargic and slamming my head with a dull thud on my desk as I snored away peacefully.

There should be health warnings with this game...

""Play it surrounded with pillows""

""Make sure your computer desk doesn't have sharp edges""

""Ensure a close relative intrudes into your room and shakes you violently by the shoulders every half hour just to make sure your still breathing""

I don't know what causes it to have such a lullaby effect. Is it the constant music that just has a metronome dull beat to it? Is it the hand drawn art which makes you squint harder than a Chinese man looking directly into an eclipse? Is it the constant vague gnawing’s of Hidden Object Scenes which go on forever? (For instance it will ask you to find something that 'pumps blood' so you must look for a 'heart' which could be in word or picture format).

Apparently I've played nearly 8 hrs on this game (7.6 which would have been me sleeping). What I can tell you is that the game was originally developed by spin top games who were later completely acquired by ‘Popcap’. It requires you to grind away at a handful of object scenes constantly until you reach level 25. With each level you raise up you get an artefact (a jigsaw piece), you also get a small entry in a journal, which offers only lame info about certain places around the world. 

After every HOS you are required to solve a puzzle, from spot the difference, word find or just doing a jigsaw. Once you have completed that, you are tortured with another HOS probably the same one you have done like 50 times already. After you reach level 25 you have to do a final jigsaw, do a very easy memory game, and then finally rotate a few disks so that they align perfectly with an outside pattern. Then 'Poof' you get to see a picture of a diamond and for those that have OCD the satisfaction that you never have to play this again.

The game also asks you to find two gems per level until you get to 50, but this really is a no brainer as you have literally hundreds and hundreds of opportunity to find them. The 50 gems unlock two modes, one which is unlimited HOS and the 2nd which is unlimited spot the difference. These are no doubt put there for people who want to induce themselves into a coma. While it might sound like I’m pulling your leg, I assure you I’m not. I have no doubt that the military are also interested in this game for weapon usage. Display this game across a projector and soldiers running across a battle field would just fall in a heap. HOS warfare is just around the corner.

Be prepared to be utterly dazed and confused after you awake from your slumber too. You might find yourself out for days, weeks, months even. I awoke to discover trump had become president. I was so shocked, dazed just like a deer in the headlights. My only reassurance is that I could play this game whenever I wanted and it would no doubt put me down again in no time...

3540,"If you have read my review on PEGGLE then you know what to expect for this review already. ANYWAYS! Peggle Nights... Such a great game to play at night after a tough day at work or if you simply want to stay indoors and chill. BUT let me tell you something. THAT WILL ALL CHANGE THE SECOND YOU REACH CLAUDE'S DREAM LEVELS! ""Oh look at me! I'm Claude and I'm dreaming about being super big!"" I swear it on my uncle's prosthetic leg you will hate yourself. I HATE CLAUDE SO MUCH and that is an understatment! I literally want to virtually punch him in the face so hard and send him to heaven (same-day shipping). His power-ups are still the same from the previous game, not even in his dreams can he be useful. He is still wearing the same stupid shorts and slippers and his dreams make no sense. He dreams to become a giant lobster because he hates when people call him a shrimp. That is not even possible you stupid crab why don't you dream about something more realistic. I hope you fall in a ditch, face-down and suffer the consequences. I also hope Claude never wakes up from his stupid little insignificant dream and stays asleep for the next game! I wish someone confuses him for food and drops Claude in a boiling pot where he will then be chopped and become sea food. Then I hope that nobody eats him so the food goes bad and they drop him in the trash can. Then the trash will drop it in a landfill. Last but not least, he will burn and become dust and nobody will remember him. Claude you suck! I will make sure to kick all the crabs I see in my path!!",True,6

3560,"from when it was released all those years ago to when i got my hands on a CD disk on my windows 7 ddr2 piece of garbage to today, this game is one of the best for relaxation. There's no doubt while other bejeweled games have better mechanic's or whatever the case may be, for me, this is the perfect game to just listen to the music, click a few hundred times as you pass levels, and just relax, it's probably the nostalgia talking but for a game that's about matching, the soundtrack is great, even has a small cult following to this day and I can see why.",True,2
3560,👍,True,1
3570,"Sadly, this is a rather mediocre hidden object game that was developed by ""SpinTop"" rather than PopCap (who only published it) - wish I'd noticed that before purchasing as PopCap themselves make excellent games.

There is a simple story-framing piece of text at the start, then it's the same New York-themed screens (with like 10 objects to find in each) over and over and over, with each grouping of 2-8 (of the 25) screens separated by simple match 3, word find, jigsaw or rotation puzzle, with no actual story (unlike, say, Pirateville from MumboJumbo, where you have story setups for every screen you play).  Got about 12 ""clues"" (levels, out of 25) in before giving up in boredom, so I don't know if they bothered with anything other than a simple text outro once you find the will...

In short, not worth the effort or the price - and *always* check to make sure PopCap's the developer as well as the publisher before buying. :/

EDIT: Oh, and worst of all, if you leave your mouse on an object while you're searching for others (to remind yourself where it is so you can get multiple in a row for a speed bonus), it will pop up a big panel, that you have to click away, once per scene telling you that you can use the hint button (no matter how many times you may have used that button in the past).  So incredibly annoying.",False,10
3570,"I got this to have that cliche game to play with the Wife.

This is a hidden object game with a few mini-games between each round of hidden objects rooms.

Not bad for what it is, but I wish these kinds of games had more mini-games and more complex puzzles.",True,9
3570,"Another Mystery P.I. Game, another about 10 hours I dumped into a game of persistence and patience.

As with the Mystery P.I. games I finished before, ""The Lottery Ticket"" and ""Lost in Los Angeles"", the principle is this: you have a huge picture, and you'll have to find objects, which often are camouflaged in color and shape. Whether you play with or without time limit is pretty much irrelevant. If you have played Hidden Object games before, you'll be fast to find everything.

The story of an eccentric New York billionaire having hidden his fortune somewhere in NY City is a flavor to the game. It is not a very... gripping story. It pretty much gets glossed over. But it's nice.

Not recommended unless it's massively reduced or purchased in a bundle. 

One Mystery P.I. game from the Popcap bundle remaining for me. But I will play and review. I must be insane.

PS: At least 2 hours are due to having the game running in the background.",False,6
3570,enjoyable enough for what it is,True,3
3570,"The Mystery P.I. games are the series that got me into hidden object games a few years ago. That being said, it was a few years ago. These games have aged much better than a lot of the HO games from around 2009 though. The biggest complaint could be that you repeat scenes during the game, but new ones added in to keep it interesting. 

There is no real story or voice acting that you see frequently today, though I don't think that is a real loss. What there is though, is a lot of quality HO puzzles with occasional simply solved arranging picture style puzzles between stages. If objects out of size perspective bothers you though, i.e. pencils the size of skyscrapers, avoid this like the plague. 

tl;dr: quality old-style HO game, worth your while on sale.",True,2
3570,"Love this.  No time pressure on Casual.  All the objects are in plain view and most are clear and sharp.  A few are in darker corners but they are the exception. There is a short Word Search, easy puzzle or 3 in a Row game at the end of each section which breaks things up a bit. Some of the ""clues"" are clever such as REPEAT AFTER ME = me repeat or Mice eat This = cheese.  All in all an enjoyable light game.",True,1
3570,"If you simply want to pay for this game so that you can waste some time finding hidden objects (like in the free HO games you can download on Anroid) then this game is ok, if you are looking for a story then there are better and much better games out there. Personally I would not recommend this one.",False,0

3580,"I'd rather leave a neutral review as it is fine for what it is, an early hidden object/puzzle game.  It just happens to be very repetitive, with very little story and uses only American English.  You type in your guesses and some matches are quite loose (tape measure = 'thermometer'? - yes, apparently) and some won't get recognised (cotton = 'spool of thread'? - nope, cutlery = 'silverware' - also nope!) which is frustrating.",False,1

3590,"This is a very fun old addictive game. I remember playing it back when it was released but still fun to play now. It is a tower defense game, where you have to protect your house using plants and prevent zombies from invading your house and eating your brain! The variety of stages makes this game even more challenging and fun. Playing in the morning time is different from nighttime plants, there are even plants, especially for the pool! 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2129256809

I love the artwork, the plants are so cute and the zombies look so funny, each one has a special ability and attack. At some levels you'll have to have a good strategy to protect your home or the zombies will easily jump at you. I have failed in some of them and had to use a video guide to win them.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2129256214

There are multiple game modes including the main adventure, Mini-Games, Survival, or just play the stress-free Zen Garden. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2162151622

Pros:
+Cute artwork and locations.
+Variety of puzzles.
+Fun music.
+Addictive.
+High replay value.
+Steam achievements.

Cons:
-Nothing.

I highly recommend it to everyone, it is a fun game to play and I wish it was a multiplayer one, it'd be even more fun.

3710,"It's an alright game. The shooting is alright and the levels are sometimes short. Jumping most of the time doesn't work at all, I had to press the space bar maybe 5 times before Dredd would finally jump. But for what it is, it isn't the worst thing I've ever played. It's a game for fans of the comics like me. Classic Dredd characters are present like Dredd (obviously), Anderson, Hershey, all four of the Dark Judges, and even Walter makes an appearance in an arcade level. The game begins with simply arresting street rats, but quickly delves into more supernatural parts of the Dreddverse like fighting zombies, vampires, and eventually facing the Dark Judges one at a time. The boss battles are pretty weak and underwhelming, but seeing all the characters on screen in a video game is pretty charming. Overall, it's a short, average FPS game for fans of the comic series who will most likely enjoy at least a little bit of it. If you're not a fan of the source material, don't play it. If you're a Dredd fan you should give it a try.",True,1
3720,"Despite managing to be an enjoyable game in theory, on a technical level the many issues start to show their ugly heads after a good few hours of gameplay. 

Bugs became frequent. Research (which is apparently based on Scientists randomly looking at things in your base) doesn't seem to work beyond a few items. Minions will run to the other side of the base to do something while ignoring something that needs to be done right in front of them (which is damn important if something is on fire). Modifying your base is clunky since you can't resize a room without deleting it entirely. Mission 5 is practically impossible since you are given an incredibly vague ""go find the nine things"" with no indicator of where the last few hiding from you are. Super Agents are RIDICULOUSLY annoying: even if you manage to capture them, they will randomly escape and blow up a room in the few seconds you were busy looking at some other emergency (such as a DIFFERENT super minion appearing on the map screen and eating your troops while, again, you were busy with something else). Something which COULD have been fixed if you could tell your super minions to JUST GUARD THE BASTARDS.

And like many management/strategy games of it's era, the game is garbage at explaining what you need to do if something isn't going the way you thought it would. As if I was supposed to know that all those agent corpses would literally make my minions go brain dead.

Asking for players to wait around forever for things to get done, while demanding they constantly swap between screens just in case something suddenly to screw them over, gets old after a while. I tried to give this a chance, and I certainly arguably got my $3 of value for the game, but I can't recommend this at full price. 

Maybe Evil Genius 2 is better?",False,4
3720,"a great oldie to play! 9/10 wish it was a bit less buggy but mods can fix anything, a great play, a must buy on a sale, i highly recommend this one over the newest! a vibe.",True,2
3720,"The game is riddled with bugs. I've played for 124 hours and haven't been able to complete the game once, due to the absurd amount of game-breaking bugs. My most recent one is when building the inner sanctum, I placed the conference table in a position with poor access to it, so after gathering the 4 crime lords the mission does not count as complete, what's worse is that, after the crime lords took their seat on the table, the table can't be moved to a better location meaning that your save is BRICKED due to a small  planning mistake an hour ago. I give up on trying to complete this game",False,1
3720,"Evil Genius is a classic that still holds up today.

Typical basebuilder management game like theme hospital, dungeon keeper, majesty etc. But with great 60's comedy spy movie flare. Its like a mix between OO7 and Austin Powers. Where you take on the role of Ernst Stavros Blofeld or Dr Evil.

Build an underground secret lair, recruit nefarious henchmen, set up chains of deadly traps, train an army of minions and then send them out on missions to spy, loot, kidnap and generally engage in chaos. While you sit back, tap your fingers together and say ""excellent"" Do all this to fulfil your goal of world domination via 1 of 3 different Doomsday Devices. Its all very Hank Scorpio.

Its not perfect in fact you could describe it as a good background game. You have it running while watching a Bond film, kinda thing. There are moments when it lurches between prolonged need for patience while waiting for things to execute, and supremely intense micromanagement.   

So its by no means perfect but once you figure out the tricks it really is highly addictive fun.

It is a game of Dry, Camp, and sometimes dark, humour.

Keep an eye out for plenty of great lil Easter egg moments in the animations too. (which are all just great)

A couple of my favs...
 - Music in the Hotel Lounge is a homage to No One Lives Forever (NOLF) great camp 60's spy FPS.  
 - The training equipment for Playboy minions is a recreation of the con-man playboy training from Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, featuring Michael Caine and Steve Martin (A great film if you haven't seen it.)

3730,"Growing up; I was cursed (or blessed) to own AVP Gold Edition and a PC which could run it. Needless to say, it was a fast-paced, hectic and terrifying experience; especially the marine campaign. Coming back to AVP Classic; its still the same, fast-paced, hectic and terrifying experience I remembered if not more! The music is jarring, the soundscapes and alien noises are terrifying & the enviroments/maps are creepy as heck (and often dark so you'll need to work around it). I'm pleasantly surprised to see that this version of AVP has steam MP & Crossplay capability with GoG AVP Classic owners - There's no hosted servers but every now and then you can hop into a online game when someone plays :) Some of the maps feel a bit short in modern standards but reviewing them; I can appreciate it from a ""in its time"" perspective, thankfully; this includes some bonus maps which will certainly extend your playtime. The only issue I encountered was a crash on the Marine campaign; in particular the map called ""Episode V: Tyrargo"" -- After completing the level pressing any key to continue crashes the game (and doesn't mark the level as complete) -- It can be worked around by pressing ESC at the end screen to restart the level -- This in turn will make sure it marks as complete. Other than that small issue; its a flawless classic! In a current age where microtransactions, online services and the same vomited mess of games cram the market, its refreshing to go back to such a classic. Do I recommend this in 2023?

3900,"Two brief bits of clarification before I dig into the actual review:

1. My playtime is a lie. Beyond the fact that the DLCs act as standalone games, and your playtime on them doesn't contribute to the base game, I also owned the CD-ROM version back in the day, and played it until disc rot made it literally unplayable.

2. The base game isn't the definitive way to enjoy this game. Get the Beyond the Sword expansion, because you're honestly doing yourself a disservice if you don't.

Now, onto the review.

I am a historian. It's an integral part of me. It's what I've studied, it's what I explore in my free time, it's what I can talk about for hours without a pause. Civilisation 4 is a large part of the reason why. It came out when I was pretty young and I was always terrible at it, but for hours an hours on end, after I came home from school, I would play Civ 4. Hundreds of hours. Thousands of hours. I played this game for [b]years[/b] almost religiously. As mentioned above, the CD-ROM I played it on eventually succumbed to disc rot because of how much I was handling it.

Even without Civilisation's long and impressive pedigree, this is quite possibly the perfect historical 4x game. It's easy to jump into at low levels, but with layers upon layers of strategy to dig down into. The graphics are aged, sure, the sound design is rough around the edges, and even through my extremely rose-tinted glasses I can acknowledge that it has its jank and weird moments, but getting through that rewards you with an endlessly replayable experience, always fresh, always there, always ready for you to make your mark on the world. It [b]oozes[/b] charm and care. The technology quotes are narrated by the late Leonard Nimoy for Christ's sake! (One of his only non-Star Trek related video game credits alongside Kingdom Hearts, funnily enough.)

I still go back to it, year after year. Partially out of nostalgia, yes, but also because it hooks me like no other Civ game really can. Civ 5 is excellent, yes, and SM:AC probably some of the best science fiction ever put into video game format, but Civ 4 will always be my beloved.

And, if you've somehow extracted all the dopamine from the base game, fear not. The modding community for this game is prodigious, and it even comes bundled with a few of them to give you a taste. My personal recommendation, if you find the base game too slow or not detailed enough, is the truly ludicrous mod of Caveman2Cosmos.

3910,"As old as time itself and about as archaic in its crude simplicity. Anyone picking up a 22 year old game in this day and age either has a fondness for unrefined and quite clunky game or a heavy dose of the memberberries.. However in the case of old Civilisation games the graphics have truly not altered that much of the core gameplay that will be very familiar to enjoyers of the later Civ-titles. Personally I picked this title up to game through the “Middle-earth: Lord of the Mods” pack that truly transformed the generic Gandhi vs Attila gameplay into a more mellow fantasyesque theme where you can shoulder the mantle of Theoden, KING! in an all out struggle for domination against the forces of darkness.. 

The base game is fine and has aged quite well, however there are alot of players reporting issues with compatibility and getting it to play smoothly. This is the pure bane of retrogaming these days and though I had no problems with my arguably ok-ish rig your mileage may vary. If you truly enjoy the other civ-titles this is more of the same, and if you, like me, was there 3000 years ago, bashing in barbarian skulls and taking names, you might find a strange familiar feeling when booting up this relic of a bygone past. 

I recommend it, but I assume I'm already preaching to the choir.. Who in their right mind would pick up a 22-year old Civ title on a whim? Well, in that case, good on you kind fellow, we will make a deity out of you yet!

Pros
- large map, Sid Meier's Pirates! gives the play the ability to explore the entire Caribbean.
- wide variety of ships, Sid Meier's Pirates! allows the play to steal and sail any ship found in the game.
- upgrades, every ship in Sid Meier's Pirates! has 8 upgrades available for purchase at m,any of the ports in the game. these upgrades improve the sailing and combat effectiveness of your ship.
- different time periods, Sid Meier's Pirates! allows the player t choose a time period from 1620 to 1680. this will determine what ship you are given and what ports are available.

Cons
- weak story, Sid Meier's Pirates! doesn't put a huge focus on the story. the story is much more of a helpful guide so it is fairly easy to complete the game without even finishing it.
- poor graphics, as previously mentioned the graphics aren't the best. but this game originated in the 1987 with this version being released in 2004 so i feel the poor graphics is excusable.",True,4

4000,"[h1]Garry's Mod Review[/h1]

Garry's Mod is a game that offers endless possibilities, allowing players to create and experiment with their own creations in a physics sandbox environment. The game doesn't have any predefined goals or objectives, which means players can create whatever they like using the tools provided by the game. From cars to rockets, catapults, or anything else you can imagine, the possibilities are endless.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

The game can be played offline, but there's also an active online community where players can join together and share their creations. The Garry's Mod community has created hundreds of unique modes for the game, adding even more possibilities for players. For example, in Trouble In Terrorist Town, players can be a detective solving an online murder while criminals attempt to cover up their homicides. In Prop Hunt, players can be anything from a ball, a plant, a chair, or any other object, while trying to hide and seek from other players. Elevator: Source, the gaming's first elevator thrill ride, takes players on an adventure to airlocks and kitten dance parties.

One of the things I love about Garry's Mod is its sandbox-style gameplay. It really encourages creativity and experimentation, and I think that's part of what makes it so appealing. And who knows, maybe my experiences with Garry's Mod will inspire me to explore game development or other creative pursuits in the future.

[h1]Steam Workshop[/h1]

The game's vibrant Steam Community Workshop has over 300,000 models, maps, and contraptions available for download, offering players new tools to improve their builds or unique weapons like guns that fire rainbow-tinged nuclear blasts from space. The best part? It's all free.

[h1]Extra Content Required[/h1]

It's worth noting that some multiplayer servers and game modes might require players to own other games, such as Counter-Strike: Source and Team Fortress 2. However, most of the content is available for free and doesn't require any additional purchases.

[h1]Gaming Experience[/h1]

It's actually really amazing to think about how much Garry's Mod has impacted my gaming experience. I was able to make a lot of friends through the game, and if it wasn't for Garry's Mod, I probably wouldn't be gaming on PC as much as I do now. It truly opened the door for me to a lot of other opportunities.

[h1]Overall Experience[/h1]

Garry's Mod is a unique game that offers a lot of creative freedom to players. Whether you're interested in building your own contraptions or joining an active online community, there's something for everyone in this physics sandbox game. The only limit is your imagination, and with so much content available through the Steam Community Workshop, there's no shortage of inspiration.

[h1]New Release of S&Box[/h1]

S&box is an upcoming game development toolkit and platform that is considered as the successor to Garry's Mod. Developed by Facepunch studio, the game is powered by Source 2, the latest version of Valve's game engine. The development of S&box initially started on Unreal Engine 4 but as soon as Half-Life: Alyx was released, Facepunch immediately requested the engine branch of the newly-published game. After gaining access to the terabyte large repository, S&box's transition to Source 2 was announced in 2020. This is a major milestone as S&box will be the first and currently only game developed outside of Valve to be licensed to use Source 2.

Although an exact release date has not been confirmed yet, Facepunch plans to release S&box sometime around 2023. According to a post on the project’s description page, the plan is to get to a releasable state over the next 6-12 months, then improve it over 10-20 years. This suggests that the developers are taking a long-term approach to the development of S&box, aiming to create a robust and versatile platform that can be used by developers for many years to come.

S&box aims to be a more advanced and flexible game development platform compared to Garry's Mod, with a wider range of tools and features. It will enable developers to create and share games and game modes with other players, and provide a platform for players to create their own content using a variety of tools and assets. It is expected that S&box will have a similar sandbox-style gameplay to Garry's Mod, allowing players to experiment and create their own games, objects, and scenarios.

Overall, S&box is an exciting development in the world of game development and is eagerly anticipated by fans of Garry's Mod and anyone interested in creating their own games and content. With the backing of Valve's powerful Source 2 engine and the long-term commitment of Facepunch studio, S&box has the potential to revolutionise the way games are created and shared.",True,17

[h1]The questions and the answers[/h1]

[b]Question[/b]

In one of the boss levels, when I try to hit NOED with the stun rod and he gets hit, just when I get to attack him he gets up straight away. Is this a bug?

[b]Answer[/b]

There is a chance for him to get up straight away after he falls, and if you had hit him with the stun rod and he gets back up straight away, then you need to get a better hit on him.

[b]Question[/b]

There are a few boss glitches in almost each lvl, why isn't this in your list of cons?

[b]Answer[/b]

I had lots of fun watching the glitches happen so I don't have any negatives about that.

[b]Question[/b]

The game says that there is a dash, when I attempt to dash it doesn't work. Help pls?

[b]Answer[/b]

That took me a while to fiqure out, it seems that you have to tap in the same direction very fast, not just ordinary ""fast"". Try being [h1]Sanic[/h1] and double tap as fast as you can. Basicly try spamming.

EDIT: or you could rebind one of your keys to the dash button in option.

[b]Question[/b]

I'm bored with the ordinary attacks and abilities. Got any tips to make combat more fun?

[b]Answer[/b]

Yes yes, there are loads of attack combos that can be mastered.

1. Pick a weapon, equip the super high double jump upgrade, then double jump press Q to spin, and while spinning in slowly in mid air, try spamming the Q button to spin and hold attack, this is a very awesome combo.

2. Use the surrounding objects that you can pick up. Remember that sticky gun? Where you shoot a glowy orb at anything then it floats? Use it on one of the sides of the long crate, then grab hold on the other end, then volia! Spin around while holding it and all that, very good long ranged weapon.

3. Try using that magnet thingy that magnets you to areas that you shoot it at, use it and swing as Tarzan while shooting from the air.

[b]Final Question[/b]

The level where I have to go to the top of the tower to where is the Antena is very high. I just fell down and now I don't know what to do and the pathway back up is too long. Got any ideas?

[b] Final Answer[/b]

Using that ""magnet"" thingy that I mentioned earlier in this review. Use it to climb your way back to the top, or maybe even higher!

I like how the game is layed out with three components to each of the six objectives for a total 18 levels. While the objective are made clear its up to the player to work out the various puzzles. 

The level design was adequate but uninspired and lacking originality.  There isn't enough character to get me hooked.  I thought the grey space ship environment was lacklustre.  Moving Blitz or stacking objects can be tiresome.  This game was developed with a good underlying base but the enemies feel like they were tacked on after the levels were designed.

Beyond that subtle difficulty, the game holds interest with its basic story, handful of weapons, lasers, a spin move, barrel throws, tractor beam, levitation gun, and a few additional power ups.

- Neat morality system, align with nature or technology to access unique skills and equipment
- Lootfest with a pretty deep crafting system
- Attractve cell-shaded art

Cons: 
- Lots of terrain issues, getting stuck on bushes, slight inclines, etc.

4420,"DO NOT BUY !!!!!!!

I really like the premise, for me Silverfall falls under the hack/slash rpg genre; it has character creation (female/male), ability to upgrade your character as you choose, armour/weapons choices.

I tried hard to like this game, but where it fails horribly :
-  is the insane and extremely difficult controls.  I found it hard to wrap my head around the mini map and the orientation of the whole game.  Plus the character is prone to getting stuck in the most awkward moments.
- extremely difficult, coupled by the fact that when you die you lose all your equipped items.  So if you are fighting a challenging boss or swarms of enemy and die, you can pretty much kiss all your equipped items good bye.

One save slot, you start from your village, in order to go on a mission you have to go through the same places you already visited time and again, fighting enemies that leveled up like you, as a result you'll wait hours for your mana and life to refill after every combat.
Waste of time in 2017.",False,21

The skill master rapidly drains your money if you don't plan out your characters, but I just started new if I didn't like a character by level 15. If you have a lan connection for multiplayer, then I'd say you will triple your game time. The controls can be difficult to work with, but targeting is simple, and hotkeys will allow you to organize what is important to your character. It also has some minor glitches with movement and occassionally leveling. Typos are abundant, but all in all it is an endearing little game.",True,18
4420,"I own the hard copy of this game, and played the hell out of it, when I was young with my friend Christopher. the times we had with this game was awesome.
The game can be tricky for new comers and experienced gamers alike as the interface and controls are a bit clunky. like most top down dungeon crawler lootfests you move your character by clicking the mouse where you want them to move, Or you can hold the mouse button down and drag it to move automatically. The graphics in the game are nice, although I'd recommend playing on lower end graphics, if you want the best performance as framerates can take a dive if there are too many enemies on screen.
After the tutorial level, the game throws you into the real world, and says ""Go for it"" one of the things you will notice is in this game you have to pick a side between either Nature or Technology. You can try to stay neutral, though if you do, not much will get done, and you won't be able to use the best possible items that each tree has to offer. Like most lootfests, you have a large amount of weapons to use, so you will generally find something to your liking. whether its swords, axes, maces, hand weapons, or halberds, you will find something you like.
As I said this game is can be VERY HARD, and I mean it, essentially this game can make you rip your hair out more, than dark souls, hard.
basically, combat isn't that hard, but the enemies level with the player, so if you want to do some grinding, you can go pretty much anywhere and kill some mobs to level up.
BUT, one thing to note, if you die, you loose all the equipment on you, and its up to you to go track it down, thankfully the game gives you a marker on where your stuff is. Although, when you die before reaching your equipment, the marker will change to that grave stone, so you have to track down your original grave based on your knowledge. Although this can be avoided if you pay for life insurance in the game. basically there is this guy who says ""Pay some gold to keep your sh*t"" which comes in handy if you feel your underleveled, or not confident. however life insurance only applies for that life, so if you forget to purchase it again once you respawn, than you better not die.
This game is worth every cent if you want a good hack and slash lootfest.

This has an awesome street view version that lets you walk around and actually FEEL like part of the city, and if you like that sort of thing then this game is definitely one you can have some fun with in that fashion.

In terms of the choices on how to build the city, it all feels a lot more abstract than SimCity, because of the way that there are these social groups and so on.

If you're looking for an entry into the city simulation genre, then probably SimCity 4 (despite its awkward controls by modern standards) is the way to go.  If you're into citybuilders as a genre and are looking for another good one after having exhausted others, I can definitely tell you that I had fun with this one despite my gripes.  But it's not one that held my attention for dozens of hours.

I was really on the fence as to whether to give this a positive or negative review.  Ultimately I felt like I had fun and got my money's worth, though, so that's the main criteria that I guess I should use.  The developer should be able to do better, and I hope they get a chance.

Factions that get close to each other fight, and they end up burning down a portion of the city, they make crime go up, or they destroy the economy. Essentially you can work up to a certain point, and the entire city will fail before you can expand further.

Another point to make, is that the business's in the game don't have any bonus's added to them, so the best way to run a city is to find the smallest building, and pack them together, because doing that will give absolutely no negative effects.

 I'd definitly reccommend this if you want a simplistic city simulator, but I greatly prefer Tropico 4 over this. The only fault with tropico is that the road system is absolutely terrible, and the only way to fix traffic is to redesign your city to situate the traffic better.",True,58

For example, the blue collars hate the yuppies and vice versa, the elites hate the blue collars, and most of the rich classes hate the poorest class. 

The key is that a fully fucntioning city needs people of every class. Someone has to be the janitors and grounds keepers. Artsy Fartsy people need doctors and firemen, and Executives need waiters at their restaraunts. People will not commute to the other side of the city for a job, so you need to manage where housing gets placed for each subculture. 

It's definetly worth looking at if you want a unique twist on a city builder.",True,23

Original game contain Tagès system protection. It seem Steam version never corrected about that.

If you want to play bundle, always install game in that order :

 1--> Silverfall (don't check files integrity 100% because installation is neverending looping)
 2--> Silverfall Earth Awakening (SEA)
 3--> after SEA install, check file integrity until you reach 100%

Never try to install SEA 1st because SEA is false standalone : it use files data shared for both original & standalone extension (like PhysX drivers). If Silverfall is already installed, SEA will only download few files to complete bundle.

Run SEA only when done, you'll get choice to play from level 1 Silverfall or level 45 SEA.

It has bad voice acting, weak story, god awful level design, several glitches and crashes, not-so-deep combat, etc, etc.

Why am I recommending it?

Because it's FUN!

Silverfall's salvation is rather fun combat and good looking player and equipment models.

All I want from ARPG's is the loot that makes me look good while killing mobs that drop loot and Silverfall does that!

Another strong point is that there are no classes.

You can spend your skill points on 8 different skill trees - that's A LOT of options!

You can be the archer that casts dark magic spells or nature warrior that occasionally turns into werewolf or technology fire mage that summons robots, or...

So, yeah, if this sounds good to you, grab Silverfall: Complete! Don't buy separately! And probably wait for a discount, because, like I said, it's not exactly a good game.

Also, don't expect it to be fun from the beginning. It's kind of game that gets better after playing for some time.

It sat on the shelf with Divine Divinity, another game I always wanted to buy but something else had more of my attention.  Having now played the latter and just finished this game I can safely recommend that no one play this game and instead play Divine Divinity if you're looking for a hidden gem.  Silverfall isn't bad but it's terribly mundane, I only ever encountered one crash and following the Steam forum suggestions didn't have any issues installing it.  I played it to the end, though I'm not sure why, it's almost mind numbing enough combat like Diablo 2 to just parade through for loot but the loot isn't very exciting either.  Overall I think this game was just a bit too easy, and while it isn't terrible it just isn't worth recommending that any of my friends play.  It's one redeeming quality, if I had to choose one, would be that it's graphics engine plays quite nicely with the Nvidia Control Panel so I was able to easily add far more AA and AF than would have been possible at release.

First up
http://store.steampowered.com/app/4420/
You need to install Silverfall as well and at lease load it once, if it keeps going to bar, you need to go into the Game folder and delete the Config for this game. Then you need 

Load Steam
From the Library section, right-click on the game and select Properties from the menu.
Select the Local files tab and click the Verify integrity of game cache... button.
Steam will verify the game's files - this process may take several minutes.
Once the process is completed, the Check Window will automatically exit.
https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2037-QEUH-3335 

Then install 
http://store.steampowered.com/app/4470/
Do all the same as above.

Then launch the game from FS:EA only and pick ether level 1 to enjoy the first game or level 45 to start this game. it reminds me of Titan Quest you have to have both installed but you play off off Immortal Thrones.

Pick your Race from Human, Elf, Dwarf, Troll, Goblin, Lizard man
Classes are Tree skills so it is really open to what you want Melee, Caster, Archer, Gunner etc. i went with one-handed Weapons and shield. and Dwarf. You can Gain followers threw quests events etc. i have at the minute a caster and a archer with me so it works i rush in do the damage they lay down covering fire and the caster is a Ice mage and Healer so really good.

There is a Stash and your backpack has 4 Tabs but there named tabs, like Weapons - Armor - Items - Crafting stuff and the first two fill Quick, but you can Quick travel vie map to town. its the basic color code most games use white-yellow-blue-orange. But this game offers a really cool gear slot Backpacks-Flags-Stuff, so you can change that look a long with your gear kinda cool really, no Shoulder or Cloak slot, but maybe the back slot will have one and shoulder items are included in cheat armor.

i Put about 10 hours into this game and it is still fun to me its kinda like PoE and Torchlight had a crappy Baby but he was a ok kid. but its more Camera control than those games.
you can Re-spec it cost 10 gold per point re-spec and it just goes up and up never resetting but you can farm gold easy.
Also you can Craft and add effects to items, but i have not got into that yet.

Titan Quest is a great and very enjoyable hack & slash game with plenty of classes and skills. The voice acting, sound effects and music are all well done. It is rounded out by proficiently designed environments, with a lot of attention to detail and extensive references to the ancient mythologies of Greece, Egypt, Orient and China.

The only shortcoming is the total lack of level randomization, making the game very linear on each of the three difficulties. But it compensates this disadvantage with better loot and a few unique monster challenges.

4550,"In my humble opinion, this is the greatest ARPG ever created, enhanced by the fantastic mod support that the community has used to the fullest. The class system is amazing, allowing you to combine two out of nine mastery trees to make your own unique class with an incredible amount of customization.  You have the fully offensive, close-quarter mastery Warfare, which revolves around duel weidling weapons and becoming a whirlwind of AoE and single target damage, at the cost of defence. Ranged masteries like Hunting which allows you to deal huge amounts of damage from a distance, and debuff your enemies defences. Magic masteries such as Spirit, which allows you to drain the life from your enemies! And 6 other unique and exiting masteries.

The world is vibrant and beautiful, starting in Greece, them moving to Egypt, then China, and with the DLC, even into the domain of Hades himself! The quests while perhaps a little generic, are very fun and easy to follow, and often give satisfying rewards along with a nice chunk of EXP and Gold! Not to mention the amazing loot you will find along your journey.

All in all it is a wonderful game, one of my all time favourites, I highly reccomend checking it out. And if you enjoy it, keep an eye on Grim Dawn, a game being developed by many of the same people that made Titan Quest, it promises to be an equaly enchanting ARPG set in the Victorian times!",True,170

4550,"Titan Quest, and its worthy expansion Immortal Throne is, imo, part of the holy trinity in ARPG's along side Diablo and Dungeon Siege. Titan Quests theme is unique, and the gameplay is so faithful to the principles that made diablo so great.
There is a massive, diverse world covered in several acts. In combination with tons of loot in the suspected qualities to keep the flow of the game intact. On top of that, the game also follows the model of increased difficulty (normal, epic, legendary), remeniscent of Diablo's normal, nightmare and hell. Each difficulty features harder monsters and better loot.

If at one point, you would get tired of the original campaign, you can try some of the fantastic mods available, especially Lilith: Battle for Jalavin (a totally newly created world which will take you up to 20 hours to complete). This mod in combination with other well known TQ mods such as Masteries mod (skill overhaul mod), gives more than enough incentive to go through the whole experience all over again with a fresh new slate.

All in all, if you are a fan of ARPG's it is a genuine crime not to have this masterpiece. The majority of the now-closed TQ studio (Iron Lore) are in the process of making a spiritual succesor named Grim Dawn (by Crate Entertainement). Given their history with TQ, this is a title to keep in mind as well and currently available through early acces on steam.

Closing advice: go spend money on this, preferably as soon as possible, you will not regret it.",True,89
4550,"Titan Quest is a refreshing experience after Diablo 3. Make no mistake: I liked Diablo 3 a lot but it was certainly a bit too casual for my taste. Titan Quest brings back the good old skill tree concept. There are no races here - you just pick the skill tree at the beginning and after several level-ups you can pick another one (the game refers to these as masteries) and as a result of this combination you will have a class. 

I'll give you an example: you want to be the expert of close-combat, an expert of swords and other melee weapons. You pick the mastery called Warfare for this purpose. At the same time you would like to summon spirits to aid you in combat and throw molten rocks at your enemies or utilise other earth magic spells. You pick Earth and there you go you have just become a Battle Mage. Overall, you have 9 masteries so you can guess how many combinations you can have. This gives us quite a high replayability value.

Other than this the formula is pretty much the same as in Diablo: 
--the story is divided up into various Acts which all end in a boss battle
--you have places full of enemies but you can rest in towns; these give you opportunity to pick up quests and visit vendors for purchasing / selling items you acquired by looting
--you kill then you loot: rinse and repeat!
--you level up and spend points on your main attributes and skills points on your skills offered by the masteries you picked
--you get to loot many items and weapons' strength is indicated by their colour; you have legendary and set items here and you can further enhance your weapons by inserting charms and relics into them
--while you are getting stronger you are expected to find items that add to your elemental protection

One of the criticism regarding Titan Quest was that it was too similar to Diablo. But if you have a decent system that works quite well why is it an issue to have it copied? The creators simply thought these were quite good in Diablo so they only changed the skill variety which I believe is commendable.

Also, the environment is a bit different as the game takes place in ancient Greek so you can expect monsters from that mythology. Act 4 is simply jaw-dropping with its River Styx and the City of Lost Souls. 

The game was released back in 2006 and its expansion pack a year later. Still, the game looks good and it utilises Havok physics quite well. One interesting thing, though: the game does not generate a new environment once you restart it, not like in Diablo. So, should you replay it with another class or on another difficulty (these get unlocked after game completion - again, a similarity with Diablo) all environments will look similar.

I liked Titan Quest. I played it after Diablo 3 and for me it was refreshing. I liked its environments with all the mythological creatures. With the 4 Acts you have at least 40-50 hours for one walkthrough on normal difficulty. I say that's quite long considering the high replayability and the multiplayer option available.

4550,"Welcome to the Exciting World of Hack N Slash RPGs

Titan Quest distills the diablo formula into a very refined and polished experience. Many will equate Titan Quest as a diablo clone, this is only one viewpoint. I felt that Titan Quest used the design philosophy of if it’s not broke don’t fix it, to the hack n slash genre. I only wish Blizzard would have approached diablo 3 in the same manner.   

In titan quest players embark on a mythological quest to fell the fearsome titans. All the while collecting valuable loot on the way, which I must say is very addicting. The point and click gameplay is assessable to newcomers and veterans alike. There is also different play styles based on the different classes and class combinations in the game. This adds to the depth and replay-ability once you’ve completed the main story once.  

I would be remised if I didn’t touch on the soundtrack. Iron Lore produced a visually striking game for its time, but it accompanied by an outstanding soundtrack.  I highly recommend checking out the soundtrack, which unfortunately isn’t something I can do often. 

One thing of note, it is strongly recommended to get the unofficial patch of the game. This fixes a number of bugs and balance issues with power sets. Unfortunately the developer had to halt patches and expansions for this game. As such the community has picked up the torch and ran with it. This speaks something about the game in its self. Not many new IPs develop a following that works to improve the game even when the developer can no longer. 

Overall I strongly recommend this to any diablo fans who have not checked it out, or any who didn’t quite like Diablo 3.

4570,"Great game, loved it to bits. Don't let my short playtime fool you, as I played this game back in the day on disk.

If you're an old RTS fan, this game is great - you'll be familiar if you've played other Relic games. If you haven't played much of the genre, this could serve as an entry. If you already like Warhammer, it's practically a must. If you don't, this may very well be a good introduction the setting, as it was for myself and many others. It does a good job of keeping it simple, and spares you from long infodumps. You learn about the different factions by seeing them in action and seeing them interact in the plot - a great appetizer for the lore of the greater setting.

The gameplay feels great, with the hard counter system encouraging mixed army compositions and combined arms tactics, and the strategic point system encouraging an active playstyle. Its basebuilding is good, and the squad system and the morale bar are excellent in my opinion, allowing for both convenience in reinforcing and tactical decisions regarding the movement of squads across the map.

Its age shows graphically, but it makes up for that in aesthetic and style. The praise goes not only to the original Warhammer setting with its unique factions and astonishing landscapes, but also to the team that faithfully recreated it into the video game. Everything about the factions and the environments is extremely cool. Immense props to the voice actors, who do stellar work of representing Warhammer's characters.

The story, as in the plot of the main campaign, is fine. It's nothing mindblowing, and some fault it for its obvious twists or lore inconsistencies, but I think it's perfectly fine for what it is. The characters, though not very well developed or deep, are distinct and serve their roles in the plot very well. You'll spot a lot of tropes at play here, but they're well-utilized. It's a story made out of elements you've definitely heard and seen before, but they all make up a pretty solid plot. This somewhat generic plot makes the setting, otherwise infamous for its extremely deep and convoluted lore, surprisingly approachable and easy to understand, however.

Definitely recommended, especially on a sale or in a pack with its expansions.",True,2

4720,"Condemned: Criminal Origins is a survival horror game by Monolith, the creators of FEAR, released only several months apart. You play as Ethan Thomas, a detective who was framed by a serial killer who used his gun, and is now hunted by his agency. However, unlike FEAR, Condemned focuses more on the horror element, having a more tense atmosphere, scarier enemies, and making guns a rarity. Graphics and artstyle-wise both games look incredibly similar, but for some reason this one has slightly worse graphics.

Gameplay is mostly combat, fighting aggressive, mutated vagrants combined with some detective work you can do at several scenes. You can only carry 1 weapon, either a makeshift melee weapon such as planks and pipes, or a gun. I don't recommend relying on guns, since they can be quite rare and have very limited ammo. And no, you cannot pickup ammo from guns, once its finished you can only use the weak gun butt. The detective work is quite simple, the equipment needed is chosen automatically and you'll only have to find the evidence that needs to be analyzed.

My main problem with this game is the movement, which I find extremely stiff for a game its age. Ethan moves so very slow, and when he sprints, his stamina runs out very quickly. This also carries over to the combat, where sometimes you are too slow to dodge or block. You also cannot crouch or jump unless prompted. Another thing I don't really like is the same as FEAR, the monotonous, colorless levels. Many areas in the start of the game are just boring hallways and sewers, but luckily it gets more unique nearing the end. And some collectibles, which unlock in-game medals and concept art, can be very hard to find.

Overall, I think Condemned: Criminal Origins is still a pretty okay survival horror, and one of the rare ones where you can fight the enemies. It's scarier than FEAR, with tortured-looking enemies that likes to ambush you, but for me FEAR is still the better game. It's still worth a try, as the atmosphere is the strong point in this game.

4770,"The Alexander expansion for Rome Total War gets a lot of hate, but it offers a great campaign, some of the best historical battles in the series and lots of features that improve the overall game.

The campaign added by this expansion is very challenging. It has a terrible looking map and as Alexander 90% of the players battles will be against the Persians, but those battles will be interesting battles against overwhelming odds. The Persians have very diverse armies of spear levies, different types of cavalry, hoplite levies, chariots, and elephants. The Persians have terrible leaders and lots of “trash” in their armies, but they also have excellent units like the Immortals who are archers that also counter cavalry, heavy cavalry that are nearly as skilled as the Companions so this expansion is not just running down easy units. The Macedonian army will mostly be phalangists and heavy cavalry, but mercenaries will be necessary to fill in as Alexander pushes into Persia, so the player also has diverse armies. The campaign has a 100-turn limit so attacking overwhelming odds-on strange terrain is the name of the game. 

Rome: Alexander has some of the best historical battles in the series. The cutscenes are narrated by Brian Blessed and tell a really good story with maps and in game cinematics. The battles have unique objectives and perfectly setup the player for doing exactly what Alexander did unless played on the highest difficulty settings. Alexander cannot be allowed to die, but he commands the best cavalry in the game so deciding when to risk his life makes the battles especially interesting. 

This expansion is great, but it also gives access to the most popular mods for Rome Total War and a number of less well known mods that have not yet been ported to the remaster. The latest versions of mods like Europa Barbororum, Roma Surrectum, Total Realism, and many others require this mod. 

Overall, this is a great expansion that simply improves the game and it is available with the Remaster as well.

The game is not gone from your library, they simply merged it with Medieval II. To find it follow these steps:

[list]
[*]Install Medieval II
[*]Go to your steam game library
[*]Right click on Medieval II
[*]Below the ""Play Game"" option there should be 4 new options with the Kingdoms campaigns.
[/list]

[h1]And now, after that prologue, LET THE REVIEW BEGIN![/h1]

Kingdoms is the expansion pack (yeah, not [b]DLC[/b], for 20 bucks you can buy actual, sturdy, [u]nearly endless[/u] content) of Medieval II: Total War. 

It includes 4 new campaigns set on different time periods and countries/continents full of 13 new factions, 50 new building types and over 100 new units. It's just overwhelming and so much worth it.

Each campaign covers an important moment in medieval history: the war for the British Isles, the Crusades in the Holy Land, the conversion of the pagans in Northern Europe and the conquest of the Americas. Some nice new elements that improve the game are the addition of [b]heroes[/b], more detailed maps, new soundtracks, new opportunities to exploit in order to increase your faction's influence and more.

The best part of this expansion is: [b]MODS![/b] To name a few: [u]Stainless Steel[/u], [u]Third Age: Total War[/u], [u]The Elder Scrolls: Total War[/u]. You replace one of the default campaigns with one of the modded ones, and you can switch back and forth whenever you want with some PC file management.

On the downside, AI is still a bit slow-minded, both in battles and in overworld map. Armies choose automatically the long way around, allies are [b]not reliable at all[/b] and it's better to control them personally, etc. The graphics feel a bit old too, but still ok for a 2007 game.

Overall, it's a vital experience for those that plan to add Medieval II in their collection with tons of new content, but it can be a bit non-challenging for hardcore strategy players.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCaRVsTZHqg

When I first booted up, I ran into a problem.  The game booted in Fullscreen Mode and immediately asked for my name.  Without Onscreen Keyboard accessible due to fullscreen mode, I was unable to enter my name.  I needed someone to type in my name before I could move on.

Once my name was entered everything was ok. Options let me change to Windowed Mode which is borderless allowing me to access my desktop easily.  There’s no other accessibility options.  No colorblind options or input configuration are found.

Gameplay so far has been point and click.  To choose what number you would like to enter into the puzzle you can click numbers in a grid & click the one you’d like.  The boxes are kind of small in windowed mode so some precision is needed.  You can correct any mistakes however.  When trying to use the keyboard to choose squares or enter numbers, I had no luck.  So far it seems you need a point & click input but we’ll keep our eye out for any changes.

The game is a peaceful and relaxing.  There’s no timer even on harder difficulties and you can stop at anytime and resume later if you’re feeling fatigued for just need a break.  Audio consists of relaxing sounds but isn’t needed for gameplay.

Zen of Sudoku has been fun so far and will definitely satisfy any sudoku cravings.  We’ll keep checking it out to see if gameplay changes or additional issues pop up, but the first look has easy to play as long as you can point & click.",True,41

I use a mouse and keyboard for this one, big picture with a controller was difficult....so i dont recommned that.

You are immersed in a universe that feels and sounds real, adding weight and importance to the decisions you make with your squad. You lead your team to the mission objective and face off with some of the more infamous of familiar SW baddies like battle droids and geonosians, as well as getting up close and personal with characters and enemies that expand on existing lore. The combat is top tier, especially when you utilize your squad right, there are scenarios where enemies do tend to suck up quite a bit of damage, but overall this game makes up for its drawbacks with the quality of the overall production of this game. This will forever be a masterpiece of electronic entertainment and I would love to see a return of the title with this level of dedication and heart that went into this game.

REVISED REVIEW:

I had to uninstall the game and reinstall a few times to get an actual save game data folder on my PC. Not sure why I didn't have one. When I would save in the past, it would say ""Save Complete""... but it wasn't telling me it was getting saved to a folder that didn't exist.

It's a pretty decent PC port of an Xbox 360 game. Only issues I really have are crashing at random points and random audio cuts during minigames. Since its age, there are no auto saves, and of course there are no cloud saves. 

I can't recommend it because you really need to be on top of saving a lot. It does crash at the most random points of the game, whether you're in a mini game or just talking to a park guest. But, if you are on top of saving after every major actor or whatever you feel, definitely give it a go. It's oddly fun, even if the minigames are just knock-offs of popular ones.

Overall, it's an OK game but currently unplayable for me. Also, 'Eets', still costs 10 bucks, which is expensive for an indie game, released in 2006.

There's plenty of content and a bunch of unlockables which make this game worth its price, in my opinion. There's also a level editor, so if you want to play this game forever, you sure can! Plenty of creativity involved both in putting a puzzle together as well as trying to reverse engineer someone else's puzzle.

6210,"This game has so many negative reviews and I've played enough hours now that I feel I should write my own review: a positive one. 

Although the visuals are not as fancy and modern as other city-builders, I found this game was far more complex and detailed than Sim City Societies while having the same kind of fun aspect. 

You have different screens to monitor things like income, reputation, which demographic of people a certain building or lot appeals to, the state of repairs of buildings and gambling machines. You can click on some staff buildings and see the employee's skills, speed, attention and charisma and how much their wage are, you can hire more employees and fire them. You can upgrade certain buildings so that they more attract the people you wish them to (e.g. you can add a bell boy to the hotel so that the VIPs are happier to stay there) . You can click on each individual visitors and see their line of thought, this will let you know of things like if your restrooms are too hard to find, if the place is dirty, if your guests would like to do some drinking while they are gambling etc. Clicking on the visitors also allows you to see what they prefer (gambling, activity, rest er whatever) and what demographic they belong to (family, tourist, high roller or else) and you can build your lot to target certain people specifically because you can't please every one (people who are looking to relax will not like a lot that has many loud buildings such as casinos and circus' that appeal to people looking for activities). 

The game has the option of sandbox or campaign. You set the difficulty in the sandbox to be as you are comfortable with and it is useful for practicing in preparation for the campaign which gets pretty challenging. The campaign includes the tutorial which is a bit annoying to go through. Also, the game doesn't save automatically and you can't save before finishing each campaign chapter it seems, bit annoying. The second campaign is not a tutorial at all and has events that require actions that were not covered in the tutorial, a bit of digging and trying things out is required to win. The third campaign chapter is more challenging even and I haven't been able to win it but as I'm learning it's getting closer and closer to beating my competitor neighbour. 

A few things I dislike about the game: there is no undo button, when you accidentally place a staircase a square away from connected to the upper-level floor, for example, your only options to correct the mistake is to sell the staircase for regain of a percentage of what it cost to place or to leave the staircase there. This makes it so you have to be very careful where you put down things and it's kind of hard to gauge where they'll go because there is no truly visible grid inside the casino. 

Also this game seems to require a lot of management: Buildings will get in very poor state of repairs if you don't tell the mechanics to go visit them, slot machines will get nonfunctional because the cashier hasn't gone to empty them and this is on top of you having to monitor each building's reputation, income generation (which you can control by choosing within a range of fees charged and, on casino games, house advantage among other things). 

Overall, I like the game. Quite a lot actually. It's definitely not a game everyone would like though but if you like city-builders and management-heavy games that have only okay graphics I would recommend this game.

Those who are looking for a high quality graphics game should not buy this game! However the graphics are decent enough and I picked this game up for £0.74 (about $1.10) and it was worth every penny. It is very in depth and is a proper tycoon game. Employ staff, buy lots and build casinos. Once you have done that you must build water and generator centres to make sure the lot is powered and water supply is maintained. You can also build hotels and shops. 

The engine allows you to go into the casino itself and design everything from where you put the tables and slot machines to decoration and lighting!

6250,"When I first bought the game for 75 cents, I didn't think this was a strategy type of game. Traditionally with World War II games, I picked Germany as who I want to play as. Instead of being evil, I hightened my reputation with neighboring countries, gave aid to countries in need, and was just being plain friendly. Then I realized that in order to make best friends with other countries, I needed their same goverment. Since I was trying to be buddies with France, I decided to go for Democracy. The only way I could think of changing my goverment was to declare war on them and immediately ask for peace by changing goverment fourm.

This was a DISASTER. France chose to decline in a millisecond. Instead of the Nazis blitzkrieging the French, the French blitzkrieged ME. After losing, I was libberated into a COMMUNIST country from the USSR who recently took Poland due to greed. I fell out of my chair laughing now since I had the support of the communists from the East, and the Italians from the South. France fell in 3 turns after I was liberated. Eventually I grew strong enough to fight back the Soviets all the way to Leningrad just like real World War 2, until they demolished me with aircraft. 

The Americans were coming from the West while this happened. I had an amazing defence on the boarder of Germany and France, and when the Allies saw this, the United States of America declared war on the Allies. I was crying by this point. America has ruined the plan for all the Allies to defeat Nazi Germany, and I retook annexed France under my wing. 

While Americans were fighting British men in Normany (where the American men were suppose to fight the Nazis), I was marching into Moscow with my swastika flag. Eventually I took over Italy, and the rest of my European allies. 

I must say; America avoided the Cold war by reenacting the Revolutionary war of 1775-1783 in 1945. 10/10 will play as America next time to create World War III = The United States of America against The United Kingdom against The USSR.",True,91
6250,"I would most certainly hope you would buy this game during the sale, or even when it's not on sale(it's a quite small price). 

Pros:

*GREAT learning experience, easy to get into, very user friendly.
*Easy moving system, nice controls.
*Easy economy system.
*Easy region control and production control.
*Not all full of reports and pop up's about battles and the economy like in Hearts of Iron III or similar games.
*Cheap and fun.
*Never really gets boring. Has different campaign starts incase you don't want to spend a lot of time playing.
- First campaign starts from 1936 and is mostly economic based up until 1939 when the war starts and then ends in 1945. It also involves a lot about the Spanish Civil War and lets you ask, or change/repeat history, whether Republican Spain would win or if Nationalist Spain wins and whether Nationalist Spain joins the Axis beyond political support or if Republican Spain joins the Allies, or vice versa.
- Second campaign starts shortly before the war, in 1938, showing the rise of Germany and their moves in Czechoslovakia and the Rhineland. Ends in 1945.
- Third campaign starts at the brink of the war, 1939, with the invasion of Poland and sorrounding countries. Ends in 1945.
- Fourth campaign starts in 1941 with the entry of America into the war after Pearl Harbor. Ends in 1945. Also involves the invasion of the Soviet Union(Eastern Front). Ends in 1945. Also has the battle in Africa.
- Last campaign starts in 1944 and involves the invasion of France by the hands America, Britian and Canada(Operation Overlord/D-Day). Also involves the final stages of the Pacific War and the end of the war. Ends in 1945.
*Has other historically correct events(unless you are the country that would've caused that event, in that case it is your choice if you follow history), such as the civil war in China with Communist China and Nationalist China, economic problems in America, Japan's crazy expansion, etc.
*Easy way to make your own scenarios.
*Lets you do what you always wondered and see what happens. Play as Germany and avoid a war with the Soviet's and see if you can conquer all of non-Soviet Europe. See what happens as Japan if you had not declared war on America. See what happens if, as the Soviet's, you make a move against Germany first. SEE WHAT HAPPENS!
*Area that was formally Allied is given back to the former country when conquered by an Allied army. Ie. Normandy is given back to France after America wins the battle in Normandy.
*Countries are never defeated until the whole alliance is destroyed.
*Turn based instead of real time(might be a con for some, but it makes it easier for planning purposes and reviewing mistakes quickly.)
*Almost no lag.
*Great mod support/custom scenario sharing support.

Cons:
*Area that is occupied is given to the country that fought first, not the country that contributed to the battle the most.
*Hard to recover from major losses in an area.
*No way to have production to reinforce in areas that you conquered back for a country you are Allied. Ie. America can't build stuff in a French factory in a region that they conquered for France.

6250,"I was initially excited by this game, but cannot recommend it as it is seriously flawed. 

The main issue is that the economy of the game is completely screwed. Your citizens demand ""goods"" and your armies demand ""arms"", but you'll find it impossible to meet your nation's needs in these areas and while you can earn cash from exporting food, coal, and oil, I've never actually see any country export either arms, or goods, which means that international trade is largely pointless. 

Cash in this game is useless. While you are penalised for running a deficit, you gain no benefit from running a surplus and all that additional money is useless, because you can't use it to buy the things that you need, namely arms and goods. As the US, I had over 20 billion dollars in cash and literally nothing to spend it on, because nobody on the whole damned planet was selling what I needed.  While you can research new technologies, you need to devote city production to this, which means that you are once more behind with your production of arms and goods. There also seems to be no way to share technology between countries, so each country is left having to reinvent the wheel.

Alliances are useless, as you can't actually co-ordinate your attacks between nations. Forget D-Day landings, where the US, Canada, UK and other countries invade. You'll invade, while the other countries will sit around watching your forces either win, or die. 

The tactical aspects of this game are bland. As the US, I simply pooled all of my ships into one fleet and sailed right into Japanese waters. After destroying the Japanese fleet that were deployed in a piecemeal fashion, I simply landed my armies on the Japanese mainland, thereby bypassing the ""island hopping"" campaign of the US historically used to gradually claw their way within range of the Japanese home islands. 

Also, given that aircraft carriers can see into adjacent squares and detect all ships there, forget the idea of the Japanese launching a surprise attack on Pearl Harbour. 

Finally, the manual is awful, the in game tips are pointless and there are almost no online guides, which is both disappointing and surprising, given how old this game is. By way of example, it took me ages to figure out how to repair damaged ships. This is done by putting them into port and changing the city production to repairing ships, but the in game tooltip just says that the ships need to be put into port. 

While this game pretends to mimic aspects of WWII, it fails on far too many levels to be an enjoyable experience.

6250,"I find that I usually only write reviews when I don't like a game, but I'm going to force myself to write one for this game, because I feel its one of the best games I've played in this genre.

Firstly, the graphics are attractive and detailed, which I find a plus for a war game.  The unit organization is easy to get the hang of, dividing, combining, and renaming armies are quite intuitive.  Supply levels are limited to one type, Arms, which helps you focus strategically instead of trying to micromanage many different kinds of supplies for your armies.

Trading is as complicated as you want it to be.  You can just put in trade requests, or you can micromanage the trades as more resources come into the market.  However, trades will be handed off to other parties automatically, which is a benefit if you don't want to pay particular attention to trading.  Although if you don't watch it, you'll find yourself trading with a nation you didn't want to, because they took over some of your 'contracts' so to speak.

Improving your infrastructure is easy and involves upgrading your roads, agricultural improvements, and reducing or expanding your mine output.  It keeps it out of your way, and you get easy updates on progress.  This is the same as choosing production, it's easy, and there aren't so many options you can get lost.

All of this is a boon to you, because it makes it easier to focus on your strategy and tactics, which to be fair aren't incredibly in depth, but enough that you can benefits for cutting off enemy army supplies (combat penalties), and you can blitz behind combat to disrupt enemy production.  Air units can be assigned to support a battle, or you can target reinforcements, producing cities, attack enemy fleets, provide air cover, they are a help but not overbalanced.  Combat is a bit abstract with the computer AI sometimes splitting up a huge number of units into small groups, it can be hard to maintain a cohesive front, but generally they will try to overcome your largest troop concentration by refocusing their units, so it isn't uncontrollable.

Historically the game tries to be accurate, with some events coded into the game, but you can have an immense impact on outcomes, even if you play a smaller nation.  I've had crazy match-ups where Japan allies with America to fight the German and Soviet menace.  You can stall the Nazi menace, or you can join it and help out, you can preempt the entire war and launch an unprovoked attack on the Germans with America, or try flip the world on its head by trying to become an Argentinian Axis super power.  The depth and fluidity of the diplomacy system is also simple, perhaps more simple than it should be, but it works well with the rest of the mechanics.

In short, the game is unbeatable at this price, and even if it cost more it's literally pennies per hour of play, and if you get bored of the included scenarios there are a vast amount of user created ones to choose from.  Did I mention the game includes a map/scenario editor?  It does, and if you wanted to create the Drakon world of S.M. Stirling, go ahead.",True,28

I like the game. But there are some things i think could be improved.
I got into this kinda games due to Making history, i bought the game. I played it and find it impossible to play with the minor countries (game editor). I also tried to give a specific country some extra resources but i haven't found a way to raise the produced crop. This is expensive on the market so i ended with a incredible negative balance each year wich causes my workers to be less effective which only makes the financial problems bigger and the factory outcome evenly poor. 
Playing the mayor countries is nice but you are being forced into the historical situation a bit too much to my opinion. I soon tried to make my own history as the game says to support but find that hard to realize.

The game has several modes, including a career mode, championship and a challenge mode. The championship is a pre-determined series of increasingly difficult races, the challenge mode tasks you with performing various timed trials such as wheelies. The most interesting mode however is the career mode, which has you competing in a variety of race types while working your way through several license classes.

You get to create your own racer for this mode and you earn new bikes by completing races. These new bikes allow you to enter even more races and once you've completed all of them, you move into the next class - the goal being to eventually win The Race Queen - the girl from the intro.

The races can be as simple getting to first place within two laps, to a multi-stage endurance race where your performance carry over between stages, meaning your bike or even your character can become beat up over time. You can enter the pit stop to allow either your character or your bike to recover. You also gain nitro by racing well. Staying on the road gives you a slow but steady build of nitro that you can use when you need a boost, driving outside the road will drain the meter quickly, and performing stunts such as wheelies will make it rise dramatically. 

The visuals for this game are quite old-fashioned but they did employ the RenderWare engine for the game and it does a good job of maintaining a smooth frame-rate with no pop-ups to be seen anywhere. The stages are pretty varied too, with plenty of locales like arenas, deserts, tropical, mountain- and country-side tracks -  and in some of them you can literally see for miles into the background.

I feel like I'm fighting with the game for it to allow me to have fun with what appear to be very exciting base elements. The story is stupid and puts you up against random enemies for no other reason than ""the angry guy in the speech bubble said they don't like you."" I decided to just fuck right off when it refused to let me finish a mission. The stupid AI kept counting down the minutes before I would die because I didn't enter a wormhole. So I figured, fuck, I should head over to the wormhole and fuck right off then, right? NOPE. This is literally the situation that made me rage-quit:
 - sitting RIGHT ON TOP of the wormhole
 - literally cannot get closer to this wormhole without being inside it.
 - Annoying AI is counting down how many minutes I have left before this fucking wormhole closes
 - i push the ""Go through wormhole"" button (more on that in a sec), which starts blinking. If I click it again it stops blinking. 

That's it. Sit until AI says you're a moron for not going through the fucking wormhole. wash, rinse, and repeat.

So I mentioned the wormhole button. THIS IS ACTUALLY A DEDICATED BUTTON ON THE ACTION BAR. The tooltip literally says ""The ship will enter the wormhole, exiting and ending the scene"" yet it does FUCKALL. A literal decade later and basic shit still doesn't work.

Not to mention, they updated the AI and made it dumber than when it was originally released. Ships now distribute energy resources and set stances however they damn well please, resetting your preference in seconds.

System control is similarly gone. Yeah you can click the box to turn off ECM and Sensors to minimize your EM profile, if you are confident you can get the task done in under a minute.

6510,"Cons:
- A bit of a janky port, but playable. Sound suffers the most but performance and visuals are good. Just do yourself a favor and turn off HDR.
- Also a slightly janky game from a different era. Expect some adjustment to its particular quirks
- The knockdown animation is brutally long and often leads to stunlocks, use the dodge (crouch+jump) to avoid attacks when possible.
- Some weapons/mechs are hilariously situational, while others excel in most situations.
- The Thermal Energy system is underutilized, and basically makes you immortal after gathering a few thousand TE.

Pros:
- Simple third person shooting fun. The Akrid and mech fights are especially fun, but shooting on-foot enemies is still pretty dang fun.
- Most of the mechs are fun to pilot with a couple exceptions, and you have a good ability to swap weapons to fit your style.
- Encounters are designed well, offering freedom of approach but remaining threatening.
- Boss fights are the highlight of most levels, usually involving tearing Akrid apart bit by bit to expose weak points or mech duels that reward good positioning against your opponent.
- The story is honestly a ride, and not in the way you think. It moves so fast but also nowhere at all, has a ton of plot threads that just get resolved in the next cutscene, and the characters have that early 2000s JRPG charm in that they're all so stupid it's a wonder any of them can breathe. I can't decide if I love it because of nostalgia or because it's so unintentionally funny.

Final Score: The year 2008 in video game form/10
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lost planet is a strange relic of a different time in gaming that is simultaneously of its time and ahead of its time in different aspects. The writing, stilted story, strange control scheme, and overabundance of bloom effects all put me in that early 2000s mindset of gaming. Still uncertain and experimental, trying to find different means of success and blown away by a new console. Seriously, do yourself a favor and turn off HDR if you don't want snow-blindness in the early levels and lava-blindness later.Some of the particle effects still look great even now, while textures and levels are a bit flat. Lots of boxy military installations and rounded caves, but some levels still manage to look really great. The early ruined city levels especially.

The thing that gets me more than anything is how much potential Lost Planet has but fails to capitalize on. It feels like a game that had big ideas that just couldn't be done with the tech, and also a game that stumbled into ideas that have become popular more recently. So many aspects of the gameplay scream for a proper reboot that pushes the player a little harder to strategize and play well, rather than being a pretty simple romp.

The Thermal Energy system is a good example; it could be such a good way to get the player to want to engage in combat really thoughtfully since it's your HP, a timer, and also ammo/fuel for the more powerful tools. It -could- be a reward for performing well in combat, since every enemy drops TE, but the issue is every enemy drops so much that by the halfway point in every level you're totally maxed out on it. Using VS doesn't really drain enough to be a worry, using energy weapons doesn't really worry you, and you have so much TE that taking damage on foot isn't an issue either.

Then there's the really slow and deliberate animation style. It takes a second of standing still to change weapons, some weapons make you stand still to fire, the dodge is slow and deliberate. It all reminds me most of Monster Hunter, which while it was a cult series at the time has exploded in popularity more recently. Slow attacks, slow movement, and a careful rythym to combat against giant monsters kinda describes both games. And the VS mechs are such a fun complement to that slow fighting style. They're equally clunky and slow as your player character, but still able to avoid damage if you're careful and can dish out a ton more damage at the cost of using more TE to run. Which has potential for a good tradeoff if you weren't drowning in the stuff.

Overall, the game is jank and very much of its time, but also way ahead of its time. I think this IP is criminally underutilized by Capcom, it could easily be a shooter version of Monster Hunter. I'll spare you all my armchair game dev design document but, I think after playing the game it's really clear how much a Monster Hunter style game about scavenging ruined cities and fighting giant bugs with your friends in VS mechs you built yourself would be kickass.",True,5

6550,THE BEST GAME EVER HANDS DOWN IF YOU LIKE NON-STOP  ACTION GET IT,True,4
6570,"I'll say it straight, I love this game. I've played Onimusha's from 1-3 and Dawn of Dreams and it's by far one of my favourite game series, with Onimusha 3 being arguably the best in the bunch... For the PS2 anyway.

With that said, this port is one of THE worst ports I have ever seen, and because it's a port of a game I really like it just feels like a slap in the face when I play it. The resolution is low by default and can't be changed for anything else but fullscreen (understandable for a game this old, but the fullscreen looks horrible if you have a widescreen), there's no way to rebind the controls (there's a ""configure input"" selection in the options menu, but it doesn't do anything) and there's no way besides trial and error to tell which keys do what because the game reuses the keymappings from the PS2 version of the game (eg. ""push R1+X to fire arrows"" or ""use the right analog stick to swap targets""... yeah, thanks). It's a downright mess.

If you REALLY need to get this game, if you ABSOLUTELY have to play it, then I suggest getting a PS2 and a copy of this game for that. It may be more expensive, but this port sure isn't helping the situation. I just feel like this PC port shouldn't be played. I mean, ok, some of the issues can be fixed through some complicated file editing or third-party programs, tools etc., but that's not the point. If this was a good port, none of that would be necessary. You should be able to play the game WITHOUT resorting to editing files or completely relying on third-party stuff. And even after you're done with all that complicated stuff, you still need to figure out and memorize the overly complicated and completely bonkers keymappings which, need I remind you, cannot be rebound. Some say that their gamepads work well with the game, while others, including myself, cannot even get the damn thing to work, which means we have to rely on JoyToKey and STILL have to figure out the damn keymapping.

6570,"When someone mentions Capcom, Onimusha isn't usually the first game that comes to mind, and i feel like when the Onimusha series was first released on the Playstation 2, they were underrated, but they are actually all brilliant Samurai games, and while this may not be the best port ever, it works and it has nostalgic value. So i love it.

If you've never heard of Onimusha before and are just stumbling upon this game, know that it is a bad port, and you'd be better off just getting a PS2 and playing it on there. BUT, if you've played Onimusha in the past, and put as much time into it as i did, you'll be able to put aside the fact that the port isn't very good, and have fun with this game again.

Edit: Alright, people are being sore about the port now. So i'll say this, READ THE REVIEWS FIRST. There are plenty like mine that clearly state that the port is poor. If you buy the game anyway, knowing that the port is bad, that's your own fault. Like i said, there are people who will buy the game and enjoy it for it's nostalgic value and can get past the bad port. Me being one of them. So i've recommended it.

6800,"A game I had a lot of nostalgia for, since I played it during my childhood.
And it still holds up fantastically, once you get over the little quirks, like the fact that it only renders at around 20 FPS (if I read this correctly on some internet page). It's nothing too jarring, once you get used to it. Maybe when you're panning the camera around. But otherwise it looks great for its age, and the 2D art aged fantastically, considering the game is now 25 years old.

The other little gripe is the fact that save slots don't display a timestamp, and since I've been abusing the hell out of the save system, I constantly forget which one I used last. Tried to setup a rule for myself, as what to use when, but I constantly didn't stick to it, so every so often I would need to reload multiple ones, to find the right now. Not that big of a hassle, since it loads almost instantly, but still annoying.
And, I think that's all I can name in terms of annoyances. It's all perfect from this point on.

As I mentioned, the graphics have aged beautifully, and still look great. There's some pixelation, but still looks great for a 25 year old game. 3D games from that period likely look awful right now. The realistic render style is beautiful, and can still very much be enjoyed. There's little quirks in terms of perspective issues, since it's 2D and it's hard to interpret depth sometimes, and you sometimes can't 100% depend on what the enemy view-cone displays, but it's fine once you get used to it.

Sound and music is decent, but music specifically seems to either be almost missing, aside from menu music. The voice overs and character lines are very nostalgic, and I've enjoyed them a lot; hearing them again.

Gameplay is where this one truly shines, and it's a real shame this genre of real-time tactics hasn't grown a lot bigger, and aside from a few spiritual successors, the market has been pretty empty. It's nice to see a small resurgence with things like Shadow Tactics and Desperados 3, and I hope the Mimimi studio manages to keep at it and sell enough to make it worthwhile. It would be a shame for this genre to die off.

The game is basically a puzzle game where you try and manage multiple enemies, patrolling around and/or guarding places, keeping track of what they see, using tricks and devices that each commando has under his belt. It's a great feeling once you solve every puzzle encounter. And some of them are significantly difficult. Compared to the more recent games from this genre (Shadow Tactics especially), it really seems like a good part of the games were lost with all the streamlining and easing of difficulty. But at least they're still being made.

I've managed to reach the 14th mission (D Day Kick Off) out of the 20 listed on the game's wiki page, and I think I've really hit a brick wall in terms of difficulty. I'm pretty certain I've not reached this point when I initially played it as a child. It's impressively difficult and I've actually hit an encounter that might be a show-stopper. At least in terms of getting through the mission without sounding the alarm until the very last moment when set explosions go off. And I've managed that so far, but this mission is really trying my patience, and I might just need to get over myself and try for blowing the alarm. 

Anyway, it's been great fun and it really shows how solid games can age beautifully and still be enjoyed 25 years later. And that is impressive.

6850,"I recently revisited Hitman 2 Silent Assassin, and I have to say that it's still a blast to play. The game's stealth mechanics, level design, and sandbox-style gameplay make for a thrilling experience that keeps you engaged from start to finish. Most missions are well-crafted and challenging, providing multiple ways to approach your targets and complete your objectives. The game rewards you for your creativity and ingenuity, and it feels great to pull off a complex assassination or escape from a tight situation.

However, the game does show its age in some areas. The controls feel a bit clunky and outdated, and it can take some time to get used to the interface and mechanics. The graphics and resolution are also limited by today's standards, which can be a bit jarring if you're used to more modern games. It's also disappointing that the game doesn't support widescreen resolutions or other modern hardware, which can make the game look and feel a bit dated.

Despite these shortcomings, Hitman 2 Silent Assassin is still a classic game that's worth playing for any fan of the series or stealth games in general.

The gun sounds are alright although as the game aged; they're now iconic. Voice-wise; the voice acting is decent and its always interesting listening to the NPCs talk among themselves.

6870,"Battle stations: Midway
A true classic

It must have been mid-2005 when I first played Battle stations: Midway on the Xbox 360. I brought the game home without knowing anything about it from a Game Stop in Washington D.C. I was an active duty Sailor when I started playing this game, and when I brought it home I figured I would have the advantage because I was quite literally in the Navy. 

This version of Battle-stations: Midway is just the single player version of the game, which is very fun and entertaining in it's own right, but there was a war that used to be waged on the online servers. 

The Xbox 360 version had an achievement named after the Medal of Honor. It was an impossible achievement to get because it required a player to be an absolute hero in a multiplayer game. This is where the memories began to form. Because this final achievement was so hard to get it required players to cooperatively work together while on opposite sides. One player would have to send wave after wave of their own men towards the other and that player would have to just make a meal out of getting kills. 

I have fond memories of working this game to the limit to get those achievements. I remember the all out wars that would happen in the multiplayer version. 

Nowadays I still play this game, but I only play the challenges levels. The first submarine challenge is a level I like to play daily. It only takes a few moments to try and sink two Japanese cargo ships travelling in an armada before getting absolutely worked by destroyers and u-boats hunting for your American U-boat. It's very hard, and I've only done it successfully a handful of times. 

I do miss those multiplayer levels, they were big and fun and winning took strategy. I wish they would release this game again but with Ai serving as the players needed to occupy the enemy team. 

What made this game so approachable then is what makes it so approachable now, it's a hard game, and there aren't a lot of fancy gimmicks on screen trying to help you win. When you shoot torpedoes 0.3 miles from an enemy cruiser it takes skill to land them in the hull of the ship. I've gotten very good at it over the years, and I encourage you to get to know Battle Stations: Midway.

6910,"in a medium that has trended towards such cop-out games that are blatant to waste your time, deus ex reminds us that there was indeed a time where games werent always like that. this is an undoubtedly powerful game that has influenced countless games after and has probably been talked to death but i hope i can still add some nice discussion.

firstly, while this game did predict a lot of aspects of the modern geopolitical and overall world landscape that are correct, its also important to recognize that it did not get everything right. i can understand why many jump to immediately label this game as some modern messiah that came to warn us about a potential dangerous future (which it definitely did do) but please go in knowing not everything is accurate. some examples on both sides would be the developers definitely getting the fact that china's hold on hong kong is even stronger, but on the other side, the UN being some mega organization that is eating up and controlling countries couldnt be farther from the truth; the UN is not nearly as powerful in real life as in deus ex and probably never will be.

and this leads to my other point. this game is not strictly advocating for anything. the developers themselves have said that a lot of the elements in this game are for you to insert your own viewpoint and create your own analysis from what is presented. it doesnt ""tell"" you to believe in anything, it simply presents the possibility or option. 

and that ties in beautifully with the gameplay. from a strictly gameplay perspective, deus ex is all about player choice. this game follows some of the most open ended level design and structure in any game i have played. i know that this game gets a rep for pioneering the immersive sim genre but i didnt expect it to be this damn good. every level is packed with such craft and the developers engineered their structures to enable as much player agency as possible. it is very hard to get stuck with what the developers offer you. there is always numerous pathways to achieve your goals and countless capabilities for unique and dynamic puzzle solving. 

the story (without getting entirely into spoilers) is way more player-choice heavy than i was expecting and i thought that was amazing. the world and the player share a dynamic relationship that creates a loop of feedback. the player interacts with the world which changes the world and now that changes how the player must interact. numerous parts of the narrative can be slightly altered due to how you approach a mission, or if you kill a certain person, or leave them alive and it just helps to great such a dense and believable atmosphere.

creatively, all top notch. the voice acting took a bit to get used to, but i did end up really enjoying it. the script itself i thought was really great, there was a lot of seriousness and everything but also occasionally light-hearted moments to just make the world that much more believable. the environments as well are all detailed extremely well, especially considering the time. that hong kong level is seriously now one of my favorite levels in any video game.

overall, i can perfectly understand why this game is still praised all of these years later. deus ex is a rare game. it is a true classic that has stood the test of time and in many ways is still undefeated.

6910,"[h1] The Quintessential Stealth and Conspiracy Experience [/h1]

My introduction to this series was with Human Revolution. I always found the setting to be extraordinary (a dystopian, cyberpunk future where corporations rule, the path to evolution is through augmentation, and there’s shadowy organizations out there pulling the strings to disrupt the status quo for their own needs). I first purchased Deus Ex 2000 a few years ago, but was pretty turned off by the graphics and gameplay initially. However, after seeing people like Ssethzentach and Jack from The Chill Zone sing its praises, I gave it another shot. 40 hours later, this has become one of my favorite games!

[b] Story [/b]
The year is 2052. The US and many parts of the world are in turmoil as the war on terror rages throughout. At the center of the conflict is the NSF, a radical group fighting in the name of freedom, no matter the person cost or collateral damage, and UNATCO, The United Nations Antiterrorist Coalition that formed after the Liberty Island bombing. On top of the unending conflict is the arrival of a pandemic called the Grey Death, which has spread at an alarming rate, killing millions, with a vaccine only being available to the more important members of society, such as politicians and bureaucrats.

At the center is J.C. Denton, a UNATCO agent who underwent nanoaugmentation to do the Coalitions bidding, along with his brother Paul Denton. As JC uncovers more about the NSF operation, motives and cover ups begin to reveal themselves as a much bigger threat rears its ugly head. With no time to lose, JC journeys far and wide to uncover the global conspiracy that threatens the lives and freedom of every person on the planet.

Playing this game and experiencing the story in 2023 was both an entertaining and quite scary experience. Considering this game was from 2000, seeing a scarily accurate prediction of a post 9/11 world where national security and surveillance was implemented at the price of personal freedom was quite the sight, not to mention the Grey Death and how it caused disruption and conflict was not too far off from the 2020 pandemic. Besides the real life similarities, the story from beginning to end is engaging and at times very thought provoking, providing insightful dialogue into political discourse and the weight of security versus personal liberties. When everything is said and done, you’ll reach the ending which, without spoiling anything, is a great, albeit short, culmination of everything being built up, with choices that are difficult to make and may not lead to end of dystopia you’re hoping for.

The only downside I would say is the voice acting at times, which is more a nitpick than anything given the majority of performances are great, especially Bob Page, who has the most punchable, egotistical voice I’ve heard in an early 2000’s game. JC’s deadpan delivery does fit given he’s basically a government agent (and this delivery can lead to some unintentionally hilarious lines like “What a shame. He was a good man…*lip smack* what a rotten way to die” and “I’ve got nerves of steel” to name a few), though the other bad eggs don’t entertain as much with their delivery like JC.

[b] Gameplay and Combat [/b]
The gameplay for Deus Ex can take a bit of learning to get used to, but once you’ve grasped it, it’s some of the most satisfying you can get in a game. Most of the levels have a main objective you need to complete, but how you complete those objectives is very open ended and allows for a lot of freedom and experimentation. There’s many paths available to reach your objective: some involving a straight shot with security checkpoints to hinder you, others involving ways around that require a bit more exploration and intuitive thinking. One of the more rewarding aspects of the game is reading emails and datalogs, which can help you bypass security, reveal key information about your objective, and even turn a fight in your favor. And if you don’t find mission critical information, there’s plenty there to flesh out the world and story that paints a picture of a horribly dystopian world gone array. You can even discover and complete side objectives which once completed, can add even more options to your way to completing a mission. Most of your information you find will be saved and easily one of the best features of the game is the ability to edit notes and create your own. You can get rid of useless information from long winded notes about usernames and passwords and even roleplay as you make notes to yourself about your experience with the story.

As far as combat, it takes some getting used to. The AI is quite predictable, but not completely stupid, so being able to take advantage of patrolling patterns and lines of sight is critical to survival. Deus Ex is first and foremost a stealth game, so if you’re planning on running and gunning the whole way through, you’re going to die a lot! This is especially true in the earlier levels where JC is nothing more than a glorified flashlight that can hear voices in his head. Gunplay revolves around waiting for the reticle to reduce in size and increase in accuracy, aiding in both precision and effectiveness. Melee is pretty much self explanatory, but can aid in quick and silent takedowns. Deus Ex also has a limb based system, which is surprising for a game from 2000. Each one of your body sections can take damage and give you debuffs based on where you’re hurt: take damage to your arms and you won’t be able to aim properly or hit hard enough, take damage to your legs and your movement will be slowed or even cause you to crawl, take damage to your vitals and head and you’ll be knocking on deaths door. This makes healing not only necessary, but strategic at times, especially when you have low healing, not enough medkits, and there’s no medical bot in sight.

Initially, JC will have a difficult time with only his pistol, cattleprod, and whatever else Paul gives you at the start. However, the bread and butter of this game is augmentations. As you play, you’ll come across canisters that can either upgrade your current augmentations or give you completely new ones, ranging from stronger melee attacks, running faster and jumping higher, self regeneration, to even bio energy redistribution to lessen bio energy drainage (your bar that lets you activate your augs, which can be replenished using bio cells or repair bots). These additions turn JC into whatever your gameplay style fits, be it a moving, near invincible bomb of destruction that can eviscerate enemies with a single blow, or an invisible ghost of pinpoint precision that no one can trace. Or you can be a fish with aqualung…don’t be a fish with aqualung…

Alongside augs are your skills, which even further tailor to whatever gameplay style you wish to tackle. Skill points are acquired when you complete objectives, side objectives, and discover new areas, incentivizing exploration even further. These skills range from how effective you are using certain weapons, being able to break into secure areas using less required equipment, being able to heal from the gravest wound, to hacking terminals with no chance for lock out. Or you can also be a fish with swimming…don’t be a fish…Regardless, pretty much every skill will benefit you in some way and further expand on how you play the game. As I’ve clearly shown, however, the aug and skills relating to water are clearly the worst to invest in, especially since water sections are few and far between and don’t really provide many benefits outside maybe one section in Hong Kong (but even there, a rebreather is nearby, so it’s even further diminished). 

[b] Final Verdict [/b]
For $6.99, I got a nearly 40 hour experience that challenged me in both gameplay and ideology. If you can look past the rough edges and occasional jank, Deus Ex is a fantastic game everyone should experience at least once.

The story was in its infancy and seemed like it had potential... Though I remember very little about it beyond 'It didn't live up to its predecessor'.

6920,"If you wanted a true sequel to Deus Ex, this really aint it. This game certainly takes place after the first game but really lacks a lot of the depth that the first game brought with it. TLDR: get it on sale with all of the other games or get it bc you want to know what Ion Storm was intending to do with the first games plot. Or just buy it for around the 5$ price range. Otherwise you aren't missing much unless you are a super fan.

Without jumping deep into the story ill just be brief and say that it lacks the intrigue and depth that the original brought with it. While it develops on that game's story by making all three endings technically cannon the resulting mess that comes after is just not unraveled in a way that's well paced or well done. However i will admit that I did enjoy the endgame a fair bit when presented with the ultimate ""question"" of the game and found it to be rather interesting. Beyond that the gameplay is a straight downgrade with a universal ammo system that at the best of times makes the game more convenient and at the worst forces you to value ammo preservation towards the end of the game. Other than that the light RPG mechanics of levels and EXP are gone and as a result specialization is pretty much gone as well. Meaning this game has much less replay value and most of the variety comes from the weapons and biomods. While that would be okay alot of the higher tier weapons and bio canisters are practically thrown at you like candy. by the end of the game i had like 8 normal mods and 3 illegals left over after fully kitting myself out. This encourages you to really do what you want when you want like in a game like skyrim however I think it just dumbs the game down for the lowest common denominator. As for performance you'll need a mod to even run the game on windows 10 and good god are those loading times long even with an SSD. It makes doing the back and forth of turning in quests a total chore as most of the time is spent just loading. The environments and music tracks are all pretty much a flat downgrade IMO. Overall the game isnt bad per say just a bit of a disappointment if you loved the first Deus Ex, it feels like a lot of the complexity is lost in favor of attracting the most amount of people rather than appealing to what made it a great experience in the first place.",False,1
6920,"Ok, the game is not bad, but it's definitely worse than the previous one.
Imho, the main issue is there's no experience/skill points system. That mean, when you finish a quest, the only reward you get is some money, and you know what? After approximately half of the game you don't need the money at all. So, there's no motivation to do side quests except for lore reasons, but you don't get enough lore either....
The developers decided to use the augmentation canisters instead of skill, but I don't think that's a good idea. First of all, there are a lot of canisters in this game - you'll get everything you want pretty soon. The second reason why I don't like the current system is the imbalance between augmentations. Some of them are extremely useful (for example, the one for hacking the computers), and the other ones are not that good.
And, of course, the ammo. Of my God. Maybe the creators though that making the ammo suitable for all guns will help players to use their favorite weapons more often, but in the reality it's vice versa. If you depleted all your bullets with one gun, that means you can't use any of your weapons anymore! It becomes really annoying by the end of the game, when you have to fight some really durable enemies.
The endings are pretty lame - the videos are approximately 10 seconds long and after that you'll find yourself looking at the main menu.
But I recommend playing Deus Ex: Invisible War if you want to know how the story of Dentons ended. The game has some redeeming qualities - for example, there are multiple ways of solving quests, and I like it.

TL;DR

The game does not support any 16:9 resolutions by default and the thief 3 gold package inside of sneaky upgrade is going to remedy that. It is highly recommended. Also, you cant get past the tutorial without it. So not much of a point to purchase it without it. Users should understand that the website, moddb , is a reliable source of many modded files for many games and can be trusted for the download of the thief 3 sneaky upgrade. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay so , right off the bat i'm gonna claim a few things about this review before anyone reads it:

- I am a regular game modder, I have made mod-lists of hundred of mods on multiple game titles many times , all of which are functional. I am able to repair most if not all bugs in any category. I consider myself quite adept at this. 

- I did plenty of research about this game, and the appropriate steps needed to patch it. From thief gold to sneaky updater, I have all of it and have installed it all correctly. Along with re-shade ( a post process injector for the game) . 

Now with all of this in mind, first and foremost I see many reviews on this page, some saying that requiring third party mods to make a game playable isn't acceptable , and some defending this stance. I am on both sides. On on e hand you cannot expect a consumer who buys a product to go to a website they know nothing about and say ""Well I can sure trust this!"". Its not really acceptable on steams side of things to sell a game and not to inform the users about what they should be downloading and where. 

Yet also, users should understand that the website, moddb , is a reliable source of many modded files for many games and can be trusted for the download of the thief 3 sneaky upgrade. It completely malware and adware free and anyone can easily upload the files to a website such a virustotal to detect any common threats, which are not present. 

Now, addressing all of the common things being posted about this game in the above paragraphs we can move on to the real details of whether or not you should purchase it. 

- ""Should I purchase the game if im not willing to download the sneaky upgrade"" 

 No , you  shouldn't. The game does not support any 16:9 resolutions by default and the thief 3 gold package inside of sneaky upgrade is going to remedy that. It is highly recommended.

Also, you cant get past the tutorial without it. So not much of a point. 

- "" But is the game good?""

Yes , the game play is very fun and extremely interesting, HOWEVER. There are absolutely still bugs in this game that can be considered game breaking that the fix doesn't attempt to fix. 

Common bugs include: 

- Infinite floating glitch, can happen whenever the player jumps but doesn't fully complete a jump. 
Can only be fixed by drawing an arrow , and then pressing the space bar to cancel the shot as to not waste an arrow. I found a Reddit post of players having this same issue 10 years ago. So looks like its been around for a long time. 

- Wrong reporting during scripted world events. 
If an NPC or set of NPCs commit murder to a civilian , the player will be framed for the murder and sometimes auto-detected even when in complete darkness and out of line of sight from the event completely. 

- No instant knockout when using blackjack ( percentage chance ) 
There is a chance that an enemy who is unaware of your presence , when hit in the back with the blackjack will not be knocked out as advertised in the tutorial , which will cause you to be spotted (Obviously) 


- Character getting stuck in objects. 
Sometimes , the player character gets stuck in certain floorboards or rafters, which causes you to have to jump to get out of the stun-lock. This situation basically causes you to blow your cover as you need to jump and make noise to fix it. Better hope no-one is around the corner. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------



So in conclusion, its hard to say whether the steam version of the vanilla game or the required mod breaks the game, but its one of the two. But seeing as how both are required to play at all, these are now just considered as regular game bugs that aren't going to get fixed. There is no active modding community on nexus or moddb and hasn't been for a long time.

7000,"Tomb Raider: Legend was the comeback the franchise so desperately needed. Crystal Dynamics picked up where Core Design left off and successfully resurrected Lara Croft in a more action-focused outing. The controls are quicker and more responsive, the gunplay more active and the puzzles have been streamlined to create a driving momentum. You could even argue it has the best version of Lara herself with a great design and voice performance from Keeley Hawes. In short, Legend modernised Tomb Raider, making it a household name all over again. The only major problem is its short length at only eight missions.

Though Legend is well worth playing, the PC port suffers from a myriad of bugs and glitches. These range from Lara's ponytail getting caught in the environment and stretching to violent screen-shaking during the Cornwall chapter.

7010,"I completed [b]Project: Snowblind[/b] on my Steam Deck. I encourage you to read this review if you intend to do the same, and I may have helpful tips for other users as well. For my opinion on the game, scroll ahead to the REVIEW section.
[h3]STEAM DECK NOTES[/h3]
First, the game struggles with compatibility on modern hardware, including some crashes and audio issues. I invested some time to get it working, First, on the Deck I used the following launch argument:
[quote]PROTON_USE_WINED3D=1 %command% -dx12[/quote]
If you've never set up a launch argument in steam before, just go to the game's properties. In the [b]General[/b] tab, scroll to the bottom and you'll see a field labeled ""[i]Advanced users may choose to enter modifications to their launch options.[/i]"" with a text field underneath it. Enter the text above into that field.

This will fix the game's audio, which will otherwise be completely broken (WINED3D). It will also fix the crashes (dx12). However, know it will also break the mouse cursor for the menus. Since we're playing on Steam Deck or a Gamepad, we're not worried about the mouse cursor. Even if you're using mouse & keyboard, you can navigate the game's menus with arrow keys, so it's no big deal either way.

Next, in the [b]Compatibility[/b] tab, I'm using [b]Proton 4.11-13[/b]. Other rversions may work, but this worked for me. I played the game the whole way through with only one crash after about a 3-hour long play session.

Finally, I made a Steam Deck and Playstation 4 SteamInput config. They're available for you to use in the Community Layouts for this game. In my opinion, my control setup plays like a modern shooter, and the game felt clean and natural, even though this PC version doesn't natively support gamepads.

[h3]REVIEW[/h3]
Note, I did not play Online PVP and can't comment on it.
I played and stuck with Project: Snowblind more because of my historical nostalgic attachment to Deus Ex and cyberpunk themes than anything else. It's a corny action game with goofy one-liners, awkward cutscenes that feature cliche action-movie choreography, writing that takes itself too seriously, and for its time, it's pretty ugly to look at. If you don't know the history, this game is a Deus Ex spinoff, but was targeted at console action-shooter fans. As a result, the game has a bit of an identity crisis, and it all stems from Deus Ex as far as I can tell.

First, the visuals are comparable with Deus Ex, which came out 5 years earlier. This is a bit embarrassing for Project: Snowblind, since another, better linear action shooter game called ""Half Life 2"" was released a year prior to Snowblind. More embarrassing, Deus Ex: Invisible War came out two years before Snowblind too, which was also available on consoles and also looked better. Visually, and in action-game design, Project: Snowblind is way behind the curve. But if you look at the game as the first Deus Ex's action-game cousin, it makes perfect sense. The model quality, the blurry textures, even some of the run-cycles and other animations look like they were lifted straight out of Deus Ex. Perhaps some evidence of a long strained development cycle.

Second, the levels are mostly linear, but with a few Deus Ex-style alternate paths, through ducts and the like. They're more compact and limited, like Deus Ex: Invisible War, perhaps. But the game frequently reminds you to use stealth, which is completely unnecessary. Unlike Deus Ex, there are no alternate story paths that result from your different choices in approach. And the enemies are far more perceptive than enemies in true Immersive Sims; Looking for stealth options might gain you an additional kill or two before everything goes loud. The game feels clumsy when you try and make it more complicated than the straightforward shooter that it really is. But with terminals and robots to dominate (with a HaCkEr GuN), vents to crawl through, crates to stack and exploding barrels to throw, it often feels like you're not being as clever as the game expects you to be.

Third, the combat is very shallow -- but that doesn't mean it's not packed with diverse features. The second cyber augment you unlock slows time. It consumes very little Energy and lasts for a very long time. With the game's starting guns, and this powerup, you can blast through basically the whole game without trouble. But the game has a whole ton of cool guns, grenades, and cyber augments, even vehicles (maybe trying to compete with Halo?), and rarely gives you a reason to use them. It gives you so many supply crates, you'll feel like you never run out of anything, so there's little incentive to mix it up once you find a combat pattern that works for you. Due to the game's attentive action-game enemy AI and mostly-linear level designs, you're more likely to get yourself injured by using one of the game's crazier weapons than if you had just slowed time and shotgunned everybody in the face (like I did). To top it off, the game has no difficulty settings. It's just always easy. A few gadgets made their way into my rotation, but for the game's length and variety of encounter designs, I felt like most weapons were very underutilized. Especially the ""Me Too"" HL2 Gravity Gun knock-off, whose primary use was grabbing supply crates or pulling out-of-reach supplies through iron bars. That said, once again, guns in Deus Ex are different than many shooter guns which represent an escalation in power based on context, rather than a playstyle choice as an Immersive Sim would normally do. So even this makes more sense when you consider that it has its roots in Deus Ex.

I must say, unnecessary though most of them are, the game has a clever inventory management system for an action game with so many devices to choose from. Modern designers might gain a bit of inspiration from it.

Ultimately, I really can't recommend [i]against[/i] Project: Snowblind. I got it dirt cheap, it tickled some nostalgia, and the popcorn action, as unsophisticated as it is, is still a good time. It's not going to compete with Deus Ex for simulation and emergent gameplay, and it's not going to compete with Boomer Shooters for raw bombastic action delight. But what can I say? There's something endearing about this awkward pubescent early 2000s shooter.

It's a fantastic RPG. I won't go in-depth, but it really is a gem. The highlights for me are the characters, the writing, the acting, and the wealth of content. I still discover things I missed when replaying it for the 12th or 20th time.

7210,"[i]Runaway: A Road Adventure[/i] is the first game in Runaway series made by Pendulo Studios, back in 2001. It has its ups and downs, coming into a résumé of being cheesy and needlessly complicated with a crude, childish charm on the side. It is only interesting enough for an old school adventure gamer, who wouldn't mind empty character stereotypes.

Let's see... There is an interesting variety of graphic and art display used in this first game; including old school hand drawn cartoons, slightly computer animated skylines, 2D characters wrapped with vibrant colors in gameplay - similar to original [i]Broken Sword[/i] series - and creepy plastic 3D models used in between cut scenes. It feels that someone failed to pick a homogenous art style for this game. 2D models + hand drawn cartoons is a great combination which we are already used to from older adventure titles, but 3D models? Well... I personally think the 2D + 3D artwork combination is a tricky one, and it wasn't well produced here. Some of the character designs were okay, but they mostly ended up being exaggerations of stereotypes. Brute and ugly rather than being funny, and character movement animations - especially ones from Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 - were downright spastic.

I don't know a lot about you, but a strong and unique protagonist with well-arranged character is really important in adventure games in my opinion. For the acquired immersion, you have to like the main character, or at least find him/her interesting. Brian Basco was neither likable nor interesting. For a supposed boy genius, he spoke and acted as a real dimwit who ends up becoming a Ken doll stereotype eventually. Gina - the supporting female character - isn't anything interesting or genuine either. She is there to live up to the labeled existence of being an exaggeratedly sexy bimbo.

The scenario is meaninglessly complicated and it seems that our characters have no actual control over any occurrence. On a series of quite random and unfortunate - or amazingly fortunate events - they manage to get by, but there is no exact brilliance to their progress. They always go through any kind of progress through the help of absurdly friendly random individuals with eccentric backgrounds that they meet around. The story itself is so fragmented and scattered, it doesn't really make any sense until the last chapter of the game. During the last chapter, every random plot hook are properly arranged and tidied up by yet another collection of random people - not our protagonist. In all events and occurrences, Brian Basco may be one of the most naive and ridiculously shallow characters in adventures games that I've played so far.

If we are to talk about gameplay, I have to confess that it has a ridiculously slow progressing game play for a ridiculously fast progressing storyline. There is odd repetitions in actions and with the speed Brian moves around, you'd better spare a whole day. It is a killer pixel hunt to collect items, or even notice that certain items are actually collectible. Some item combinations are just fine, the others... well, without a walkthrough I wish utmost patience for you. NPC interactions and dialogues are pretty much straight forward, but even though you'd be pretty confident about what you should do, the game forces you to either confirm that through making Brian realize the needed action, or at least try what you absolutely cannot do first as an elimination process. It ends up being tiresome after a point.

All in all, [i]Runaway: A Road Adventure[/i] is nothing miraculous. There is a great selection of adventure games you'd enjoy without a doubt. This is not really one of them if you are not a fan of cheesy character stereotypes and crude elementary level humor. I've been hearing a lot of good things about the other games in the series - especially [i]Runaway 3: A Twist of Fate[/i] - so I'll finish the series to get there anyhow. Apparently, story arcs follow each other with references so it is not possible to thoroughly enjoy the last game without playing the prior ones. Take this one if you are curious enough, or wait for my reviews in other titles in the series!

7210,"This game is one of the worst experiences I have had, though I suppose part of it can be forgiven considering the age of the game. The game starts right off with you saving a barbiesque girl from some thugs. The protagonist is sure to tell the audience direcly about how beautiful the girl is and that this the main reason why he won't refuse to help her. The game is contradicting at times between the antagonists wanting to kill the girl at first, but then after catching her they want to interrogate her. The game also weirdly dips into native americans and then the supernatural, before ending on a relatively normal note. The final revelation of the plot is probably the only thing interesting about it. Mostly, the game seems to take itself too seriously for how bland it is.

While the models are simple and cel-shaded, the animations leave something to be desired. Talking animations often appear to be 2-frame mouth open/mouth closed animations. Interacting with people is often delayed while they finish an idle animation they are in the middle of. Characters aside from the main ones often stomp or shuffle around in ways I can't tell to be intentional or not. 

The first few 2 chapters had some decent puzzles, but afterward it is increasingly difficult to determine what you are supposed to do. There are multiple times when you have an idea of what to accomplish, but with no idea of how it relates to your current goal. As the game approaches the end, the puzzles seem more like exercises in mind reading on the developers. At one point I had to give the name of a movie director and one of their movies to another character as it was tangentally related to a solution for a problem the protagonist had at the time. There was also a time when I was to cut a ""rock hard"" object with a knife that had been heated, because it would cut better. A third one involved throwing a basketball to a particular character because they were secretly used to be a famous basketball player. In none of these scenarios did I find any clues to the answers.

A few other bullet points:

- The end of the game gets pretty tedious as you repeatedly leave objects for other characters to examine, leave the room, and come back.

7210,"This is the first in three games that form the Runaway series to date. As such it is bound to be potentially less refined than the latter two so there are some issues with it and things that detract from my enjoyment of the game. I hope as the series progresses they get better and better but for now here is my review of the first title in the series...

The first aspect is the art style, it appears cell shaded in format or what I would associate as such and it is an aquired taste as far as artistic styles go...unfortuantly in this specific case it is not a taste that fits well with me. Normally I do not mind cell shaded looking games but this is on the poor quality side where quite often I found myself looking at the shading on the characters and thinking what the hell is wrong with their face or body which maybe okay for a while for the amusment of looking at weird shaded and shaped characters as some times it was just plain freaky looking but kind of wears thin on me after a while. 

It comes across as like a premature/immature use of the art style inline with the time period where the game came out which I think was early 90's and it may well be the case that the following games in series matured and refined this art style but that's more related to future reviews of those not this one. However I am sure there are enough screenshots and such online and in the community section for this game here to give you an idea of whether it is an art style you can grin and bare or might enjoy. For me it was the former and for others it may be the latter. The environments on the other hand are not too bad, some are even quite good I feel for the most part but the characters on the other hand are ugh...not to my liking and quite often look very odd or creepy.

The VO work is okay, not amazing but not too bad either. Nothing to write home about though. There were some glitches and bugs I came across when playing, screen freeze couple times and on some occasions glitches relating to the the VO/animations. I thought it is worth mentioning just incase happens to others too. It was not game breaking in the sense I was able to reload from last save and continue but it might be worthwhile if pick up this game to keep saving manually often just in case.

The introduction music track and general theme song Runaway one is catchy and a nice tune. It was a nice enjoyable peice of music but for the rest of the game there is pretty much a lack of music to add to this nice audio start to the game. The puzzles in this adventure game are also not so great in the sense for the most part yes you will be able to proceed without hinderence for a fair amount of the game just by using simple logic...but there are some that defy belief and boggle the mind in a not so good way. You will most likely need to use a guide or walkthrough to solve some just because some defy logic. 

I will give just one example so not to spoil things where the game fails in this regard. There is a train and you can add water to the engine boiler by going to and from town, filling up a handheld item with water then back to the train to put it in the boiler. When you add water and check the water level it tells you the same thing each time that the water level is still very low. You can repeat this process over and over and will tell you the same thing and on the fifth or sixth try something will pop out of the chimney that you will need to progress in the game. Now here is the problem. Firstly there is no hint or anything like that letting the player know that he should keep going to and from the town and train adding the water over and over or that anything will happen or that anything should happen. The repeated phrase of still low on water after th first few times most people would stop doing it thinking it serves no purpose since game does not tell you has any purpose at this point. You will reach a point where cannot continue the game until decide to go back to putting water in for no apparent reason.

There are also ones which annoyed me in the sense I had collected items that could solve situations had the game let me combine or use them logically but the player is forced to find a different way not because your way would not work if was allowed but because the game expects you not just to solve the puzzles but to solve them the exact way the developer would solve them and this is very annoying. While there is an element of this in most adventure games, in this one it feels blatent and annoying. When you solve some of these puzzles you may feel like shouting eureka but not because you want to pat yourself on the back for being smart but because you managed to figure out what the hell the developers were thinking when they made that puzzle. I might be sounding harsh but some of these puzzles are simply bad. Not all however are so bad, some are generally okay and while you will come across bad ones there are quite a few logical and non brain exploding puzzles in there too that most people should have no problem with.

The story itself is okay, interesting in parts but average in others. The romance aspect feels very forced and this reflected badly on the characters to me. This game was made in the early 90's though so I never expected it to be up to todays standards in many areas but overall as an adventure game it felt like an average game, with a few very annoying puzzles but with good introduction song and an interesting art style provided the art style does not rub you the wrong way. I can only hope the rest of the series gets better and will be trying those in order as I go along at a later date. I have higher hopes for the rest of the series which were developed about two years apart if I recall, expecting and hoping that they improve with each new one in the series as they learned from their mistakes. 

The ending was very predictable, but that is to be sort of expected given it's the first in three games that carry a narrative follow through between them from a timelime and characters perspective. I won't spoil it but it is worth noting that the series is linked in such a way so that while you could start with the second or third game and skip this one, you will not get the full story relating to the characters and and may not understand everything that's going on or why things are the way they are unless play them all in order. It's not as bad as say starting watching the LoTR skipping the first and starting on second film in series instead and wondering what's going on but there is a link between the games in this series so worth keeping that in mind.

Should you buy this? Well depends on what floats you boat but for me this was an average game, nothing making it stand out far enough to scream buy or don't buy... more of a if you are bored, like adventure games but played all the best ones already and need to start playing the average ones before making a start on the worst then this fits in that average catagory. My advice is maybe pick it up during a sale. It's not bad enough that I will say do not buy it, so I will say recommended but only for those who fall into the above catagory I just listed if your anything like me. 

If determined to buy an adventure game made by Pendulos Studios I would much rather recommend (The Next Big Thing) game from them which actually is a very good adventure game compared to this one which I consider to be average.",True,25

The first Runaway game is an extremely beautiful point ‘n’ click adventure with bad voice actors, and needlessly overcomplicated plot and puzzles, completed with a last act that redeems most of the game in one swoop. Be prepared to use a walkthrough from the start though.

[h1]Long version:[/h1]
Pendulo, a Spanish studio tried to revive the dying point ‘n’ click genre at the start of the century by releasing their first decent hit, Runaway: A Road Adventure. The game stood out with its spectacular, lushly coloured, hand-drawn backgrounds and cell-shaded 3D characters. (The latter technology was a big rage at the time.)
And this is also where most of the budget went, because the lavish exterior hides a rather lacking adventure game.

The most apparent issue is the audio. The main theme is catchy (albeit dated), and the soundtrack is good, but the voice acting ranges from somewhat tolerable to downright horrible.
The less-apparent problem is the writing. Initially it seems great: a rather everyday protagonist accidentally gets dragged into a spy thriller by accompanying a beautiful woman. Then it just flips out and throws in locations and characters at random without any coherence. Heck, it even resorts to using aliens and magic.
Thankfully this mess is sorted out by the end, resulting in a good mafia story, but this is a very small compensation for all the stupidity you have to endure before it.
 
The puzzles are worse. Remember the infamous passport sequence in Gabriel Knight 3? Imagine that as the starting difficulty, getting more convoluted and illogical at every new step you take. And the solutions themselves are on rails: you cannot do what you are supposed to do unless you find out all requirements for even the most basic actions.

At its time, Runaway was a welcomed comeback of the adventure genre, but today it is just a pretty, but dumb piece of point ‘n’ click history.",True,14

Honestly, I could never really get into this game. From the first room I ran into trouble progressing. It is no news that some adevnture games contain illogical or infuriating puzzles, but usually you get the hang of it by carefully reading the dialogue and/or exploring. I had to heavily use a guide, when I usually refuse to use guides at all, as they destroy the purpose of those games but in the end I prefer it over examinating every pixel in every room every time you progress a little bit.

7220,"Well... Here is the continuation to Runaway series, [i]Runaway: The Dream of the Turtle[/i], made in 2006. Aside that little bit of factual definition, there is not a single good thing to say about this game. If you've played the first game and declared it a tasteless, tacky and overcomplicated little adventure full of character stereotypes as I did, be warned: This is way worse than the first game. At least, the first game was working properly!

Adventures of self-acclaimed genius Ken doll Brian Basco continue from where we left him: on a vacation in Hawaii with the oversexualized bimbo stereotype Gina who he ended up as lovers beforehand. Thanks to a series of unfortunate - and mindlessly obvious - wrong choices, Brian ends up surviving a plane crash to only get stranded on an island invaded by military forces, missing Gina without a clue to her whereabouts. How...very...convenient. As before, his story will start with a destined accident and progress to become ridiculous, fast pacing and needlessly complicated over a short period of time. Buckle your seats, and be ready for alien conspiracy theories.

First and foremost, I really have a problem about the story execution in this game. In the first game, we went through a series of absurd events and got blessed with miraculous luck so random strangers with extraordinary talents and means ended up helping us regularly to get a happy ending. Brilliant. Here in this continuation, the same dynamic applies - but the game is needlessly extended to present the illusion for the presence of a game time. The first 3 chapters that take place in Mala Island are somewhat consistent with the main story if not harbored with annoyingly superficial humor and aroused teenage level sexual remarks. The rest of the game is an unbearable story anchor for situational comedy purposes mostly. The whole chapter 4 is only there to serve as a situational comedy during a supposed intergalactic emergency! Look, I can appreciate absurd humor, I loved every single moment of [i]Monkey Island[/i] series, but there is nothing funny about deliberately feeding a complete stranger to a polar bear's sexual frustration, just because Brian decided to icefish at the spot the bear's standing! It's plain disgusting.

Aside a slight improvement on graphics and in-game animations, the game uses the same character design, 2D environments and a combination of 3D modeled cut scenes alongside 2D dialogue sequences among characters. Gosh, even the design choice is over complicated here! Fair warning: 3D cut scenes where Brian talks to Sushi, beginning from the start of the game, are spastically slow for some reason. Speaking of bugs, first 3 chapters of the game work fine, but the game gets unbelievably slow when you reach 4th Chapter. It takes a couple seconds to even move the mouse from one point to another. I think it's a problem with the snowing animation. I tried everything in my ability but couldn't find a way to mend it so I ended up closing the game and finding a YouTube playthrough to watch the rest to learn the story. This bug occurs with both Windows 7 Pro and 8.1 Pro. Be warned.

As before, game logic is flawed - not letting you go for the obvious solution before trying everything else to be rejected properly is our main thing. But ask yourself this: what kind of dimwit of a protagonist gets snow shoes to his inventory in a tropical island and leaves first aid kit behind, after a plane crash??? Such is our game logic. Puzzles are somewhat simple, but story progression and dialogues are a pain to go through. I'd vote for ""nope, surely there is something better to do"".

If you enjoy crass humor and are fond of ""It was aliens!"" skets - and able to forgive not being able to play half the game - sure, go for it. Otherwise, avoid it. Yeah, I will still play the last part of the series to get done with it and write a review. I know, I know. I love my community...

The second Runaway game is more beautiful and even stupider than the first one. If you like immature sex jokes and rampant racism, and don’t mind horrific plot dump dialogues, you may have some fun, but otherwise just skip it. (It’s not even needed for the third game.)

[h1]Long version:[/h1]
Runaway: A Road Adventure was a beautiful, but overcomplicated point ‘n’ click with ridiculous puzzles, terrible voice acting, and a story that eventually turned out to be quite nice in the very end. The Dream of the Turtle has no redeeming factors other than better graphics; everything else is worse.
Much, much worse.

The voice acting will make you cringe, especially after you meet Joshua, who is the most offensively racist stereotype you will ever see in a commercial video game, ever. And, again, this is the [i]smaller[/i] issue.
The larger problem is the plot, which is beyond stupid. Not because it is about unravelling a government conspiracy about aliens– real, actual, tinfoil suit wearing, bug-eyed aliens–, but because it has no direction or story structure: things just happen out of nowhere without rhyme or reason. Also, the humour is mostly sex jokes. Very childish sex jokes.
The insane, but entertaining characters are also replaced by one-dimensional clichés. Brian is now a goatee-wearing muscular douc[i][/i]hebag who cheats on his girlfriend while she is being held in captivity. One of the antagonists is a military operative dominatrix with spider fetish. And don’t we ever forget Joshua, whose entire role is to extend all puzzles by ruining your initial solutions.

On the topic of puzzles: get a guide. Don’t even attempt to play this game by yourself. None of them make any sense, and they are so overcomplicated even walkthroughs can get entangled in their stupidity.

Is there anything good in this game besides the graphics? No, but the final Runaway title will redeem the series, if you manage to stay on board…",False,42
7220,"Runaway, Dream of the Turtle is the second installation after Runaway , Road adventure which I also played. Those games are made in the typical point and click adventure styles which was made famous by classics like Monkey Island or day of the tentacles in the 90s. Those games with some others made in the 90's are seen as the pinacle of adventure games, with their smart puzzles, great stories and humour, a golden age which is gone. Although adventure games are not as numerous or famous as they  once were, they are still around in the new millineum with various grades of quality and enjoyment.

Runaway , Dream of the Turtle, developped in 2006 is made in this spirit, a new take on adventure games with better graphics and newer functionality . I liked Road adventure , the first Runaway, well enough and it seemed Pendulo which developped the game had even more ressources to make this game, with better graphics (2,5 D animations some places) , nice, cartoony and longer cutscenes, more characters and longer story than before. 

But I rather think this game is inferior to the first for several reasons:

The characters:
Where to start? the main character, Brian Basco, which was sympathic if not very interesting in the first installement, has become a arrogant douchey prancing in eurotrash cargo pants with a goatee on top of being boring and annoying. As a main character, he is also not a very nice person. During the game he basically two-times his girlfriend (who he is supposed to save) with the local bimbo on an island, then he litteraly pimps out his newfound lover in order to advance the plot, very classy. On another instance he  throw a character who actually wanted to help him litterally into the arms of an lustful polar bear, for an unclear destiny of either being maimed or violently violated. He might have gone away with it if the scene was funny, but it wasn't , my reaction was of pity and discuss mainly...

He get a little less annoying by the end of the game, but it's too little too late...

The other characters which help or counter our ""hero"" are not much better,it's a mixed bunch of annoying and forgettable clichè characters , some of them are bearable. in a few instances they might bring a smile on your lips, but don't expect much. The ones that are really annoying like Joshua will make you cringe, just think of something nice while they are in a scene...

The Graphics:
Honestly for a game from 2006, they're pretty good, the backgrounds are colourful and diverse and save the whole game from being a complete chore. The characters if you look away from their personality are cartoony and nicely done, my main critic is how frozen they look and how unnatural they're moving around. You could get away with it in 1994 when everything was pizelated, but I kind of expected better animations from the 2000's. The sounds and music are forgettable but ok.  

The puzzle.
Nothing revolutionnary here, the normal point and click routine. While some of the puzzles are ok both in complexity and logic, some others are really hard and arcane, and you end up trying all kind of combination or to save time and your nerves, check a walkthrough.

In few instances I manage to solve a puzzle by luck , I couldn't help but feel bewildered by the unlogic solution. Other times , the whole setting didn't make sence, like when you have to solve a rather complex chains of events to get a measly notebook from another character while roaming in a huge and expensive multimillions dollars yacht full of expensive stuff. 

To be honest the puzzles in the game are no worse than in many other middle of the road adventure games, but they're not better either, if you put on top of that a rather unlikable main character and annoying surroundings, it just makes thing worse.

The story and dialogs
The story is rather forgettable and not especially intersesting, which would have been ok with good characters and nice and witty dialogues, but Runaway , The Dream of the Turtle has none of that. It could have been if the writers had put more time in designing their characters to be more interessting and put some humour in the game through the dialogues. But instead we've get one liners that aren't even remotely funny and strange situations that don't make sence, since they were intended to be humourous but weren't.

The creative minds behind this game this put some effort in putting most of the poor female characters in vaguely sexy skimpy outfit , probably to appeal to the more juvenile segment of the player with a bit of softcore . But it end up giving the game an almost mysoginistic feel since most female characters end up being just eyecandies at some level.

Conclution:
It's definitively not the worse adventure game out there, but it's really not among the best, it's barely mediocre. I didn't hate playing it, but I definitively won't repeat the feat. The sad thing is that it could have been a lot better if they had put better writers to bring up more interesting characters with better and humourous dialogues.",False,37
7220,"In some ways, an improvement on the first Runaway game, in others, it's not as good. If you enjoyed the first game, I'd pick this one up for sure, but I probably wouldn't recommend approaching it without. The first half of the game is set in beautiful tropics and the colour and art is actually really nice. Some... interesting writing and a few annoying puzzles, but the last half hour will be some of the most frustrating that you will have ever experienced.

7220,"I love adventure games. I do. And I lkied the original Runaway way back in the days of VGA.

Pendulo has to have some of the worst dialog and plot writers working in games, or their translators should be horsewhipped...it's hard to know who to blame. But either way, the dialog and plot are stereotypically gawd-awful. And the puzzles suck. Suck hard. No happy ending either.  Just a ""to be continued"" at the end of the game.  Skip it. Really.",False,23
7220,"Positives:
- beautifully drawn backgrounds and the cell-shaded character models look good (unless in extreme close-ups, which the cutscenes love to use)
- sometimes(!) the main character is, for your convenience, very smart when solving puzzles and will automatically combine the correct items if they are in the inventory, or even pick up needed, but trivial to obtain items without further input required (e.g. early on, stranded in a jungle, you can't reach an object, and Brian automatically gets a branch to pick it up with)
- hearing Jon St. John is always a delight

Neutrals:
This game is truly unique. What other game has your main character spend a significant part of the story in blackface, and a Japanese-American side character whose design comes straight from WWII ""Slap a Jap"" propaganda, whom you cure of amnesia by feeding him sushi, since, ""due to his Japanese blood, he must like sushi"" (Actual reasoning in the game dialogue)?
Whether this constitutes a hilarious middle-finger to an oversensitive world of political-correctness-gone-mad, or quite simply cringe, is up to you to decide.

Negatives:
Oh boy. It's not a good sign when a goofy side-quest about a weirdo trying to contact aliens is chosen to become the central story of the sequel. The plot spends little time on the rails and is told in large parts in awkwardly paced flashback and exposition dumps (oh, and watching characters communicate via online chat and having to wait a realistic amount of time for their counterpart to type and send the response is truly riveting).
It's clear that the writers where struggling as the later sections of the game fall completely apart, the crown jewel being the main character teleporting to a new setting between chapters and suffering amnesia how he got there, so side characters can deliver the events in dialogue (with ""don't worry about [plot issue], we've taken care of that. It's no problem anymore"" being an actual line).

Speaking of dialogue, the wording is frequently awkward and unnatural, as if the script was translated from Spanish by someone who's not a native speaker of English, or was really struggling to translate Spanish idioms and language quirks. You'll often have confusing lines where, for example, a characters says ""No problem"" to a request, but means ""No, there's a problem"".
There are several sections where you have to repeatedly initiate dialogue, only for the (LENGTHY) dialogue to be repeated verbatim. 

But all that's nitpicking, if characters are endearing and puzzles are fun, right?
Well, regarding characters, the writers have the unfortunate tendency to confuse ""quirky and eccentric"" with ""obnoxious"", in fact, all characters seem to have made it their mission to be as obnoxious as possible. Of course, uncooperative characters (that you then need to convince, trick or get rid off as part of the puzzle) are a staple of adventure games, but here, you feel the game is just trying to waste your time, main character included. Brian will routinely comment on correct actions with your stock adventure phrases ""I can't pick that up"", ""There's nothing there"", ""I can't use these items together"", only to, after a comedy beat, say ""Wait, I see something"" or ""Wait, if I attach it like this..."" and then the puzzle works. It's a funny meta-joke for adventure fans once or twice, but it become old REALLY fast.
It doesn't help that Pendulo's idea of making nerd Brian ""cool"" for the sequel (which he obviously must be now, having scored the hot babe) was to turn him into a douchy dudebro.

As for the puzzles, ""moon logic"" is often the term - it's the kind of stuff that makes even an adventure fan understand some of the vitriol that detractors raise against the adventure genre. The game's most unforgivable sin in this respect is that it punishes you for being clever: Brian will refuse to pick up, use, or combine items if you haven't ""unlocked"" the ""idea to do this"" or ""need to do this"" via dialogue or looking at the right object yet. Now it's great if adventure games give clues and hints that way, but to make it mandatory to find them is a terrible design choice. However, to be fair, in those cases Brian will usually say something to the effect of ""I don't see a need to do that yet"" instead of the generic ""I can't do that"" to let you know that you're on the right track, but that doesn't make hunting for the ""epiphany trigger"" any less frustrating.

All these flaws compound and exacerbate each other in a way that make the overall experience a teeth-grindingly annoying slog, even with a guide in hand (the recommended way to play the game, for your sanity's sake).
If you just want to sit down and have a fun few hours with enticing brain-teasers, AVOID this game.
Only play this game if:
- you are an adventure game completionist
- you are into ironic enjoyment and/or masochism
- you are a game designer or have a scholarly interest in game design and you'd like some examples of what NOT to do

PS: Dear Spanish people: is ""jumping around and slapping your own behind"" a common visual metaphor for ""s*xual activity or s*xual excitement"" in Spain? Because that happens repeatedly in the game.",False,20
7220,"NOTE: I had a lot of trouble running this game on my Windows 7 64 bit PC. It was unplayable even after attempting every fix I could find. Apparently this is due to an issue with AMD video cards. I had to run it on my laptop and use the new Steam In Home Streaming option to play on my PC. However, I still had issues with crashing, especially towards the end of the game. Keep this issues in mind when choosing whether to purchase this game.

Runaway, the Dream of the Turtle is a point and click adventure game by Pendulo. It is the sequel to Runaway, a Road Adventure, and the second in the Runaway trilogy. In this adventure, Brian and Gina are continuing their island vacation shown at the end of the previous game. Things go awry, however, and Brian must become the hero once again.

Mechanics in this game are exactly the same as the previous entry in the series. You can switch between looking at and interacting with objects using the right mouse click. Double click on scene transitions to switch quickly to the next scene.

I did not notice much of a change from the graphics of Runaway, a Road Adventure, so my same critiques apply. Backgrounds look great once again. There are more of a variety in backgrounds as well this time, which is a nice addition. Character models could use some improvement. The voice acting is mostly similar, so serviceable without any major complaints.

There are some story concerns this time around. Once again, almost zero interaction is had with Gina through the majority of the game, so it's hard to feel an attachment to her. Brian must feel this way too, since he jumps at the first new girl he finds on his adventure. I do have some issues with one of the characters, Joshua. He feels a little too much like a stereotype for my liking. The man character also dabbles in some light racism through the use of blackface while in disguise. The main character, Brian, comes off as very punchable during the first half of the game is in island attire. I believe it is the combination of soul patch and spiky hair that does it. The humor overall is funny at times, corny at others. There are some problems with pacing, with some areas done in a flash and others taking a very long time.

The puzzles are very similar in style to the previous game in the series. You will have to spend some time trying to pick up everything in the scene to see what works. There is a fair bit of combining objects to complete puzzles. Some use the dreaded adventure game logic, but there are no unwinnable scenarios or deaths so you really just need to keep plugging away.

Overall, I see Runaway, the Dream of the Turtle as on par with Runaway, a Road Adventure. There are some positive developments, such as variety, and some negatives. I would have given it the same score and my recommendation if there had not been a problem running the game. Since performance is spotty for AMD video cards, and I even had some crashes with my Nvidia based laptop that caused me to lose a good deal of progress, I cannot recommend this game.

Score: C-",False,15
7220,"It's bad. It's really bad. Everyone that says so is right. I have enjoyed many a Pendulo game, but this one takes the cake. I'd heard the Runaway series was not great and I had bought it years ago and I was always hesitant to play, but finally I started playing them and I got to the second game and it was so bad. It was anger  inducing bad.

Brian has become a grade-A d-bag. Other reviewers have said this, and it's absolutely true. He has become the kind of guy that no one likes. You want bad things to happen to him. I mean that is enough to make the game bad. No one would be interested in a sequel if it weren't for that character.

Despite how much I disliked playing as Brian let me sum up a few more things. Puzzles make no sense. NO SENSE. Whatsoever. They are so unintuitive and there are so many objects that just aren't obvious you can interact with. This carries over the problem of the first game where Brian won't interact with an object or pick it up until it's useful which ""makes sense"" but it doesn't make it easy and you don't remember that after advancing the game a little you probably need to try everything all over again to see if Brian will do something new now.

Ultimately I'll play the third game, even though I didn't enjoy this one. I've come this far I may as well finish the series. Who knows. The third game might be better. I've heard it is, and certainly Pendulo's later games have been very good. I have my fingers crossed.",False,11
7220,This game rocks and I recommend it to any fan of point and click adventure games. Yeah the ending leaves a lot to be desired but it is the second game of a trilogy. The writing is hilarious and most of the puzzles are fun. Definitely try it out but play Runaway first!,True,11
7220," For those of you who don't know this is the second in the series and much like the first it once again follows Brian Basco or at least a man with the same name. This time around Brian finds himself crashed on an island filled with secrets and it's up to him to find Gina before something bad happens to her.

 To be honest I didn't enjoy this one as much as the first but it was alright, I prefer the Brian from the first game and it almost feels like the two are completely different characters during the game. This was my least favorite of the trilogy but it was still a fun playthrough for the most part.

 I reccomend buying this only if it's on sale and only if you have all the other adventure games on your to do list crossed off as this game although fun isn't as good as some of the bigger named titles in my opinion.

7670,"Can you name a better intro to a first-person-shooter? No, seriously. Can you? Half-life 1 is perhaps the closest, and both share striking similarities. A catastrophic disaster, an awe-striking yet mysterious location, no cutscenes whatsoever – complete player immersion. Yet Half-Life 1, for all its beauty, is still nowhere near as well written as Bioshock.

The player is immediately swept up in an airplane disaster and ushered into an underwater carriage. From there, the charismatic Andrew Ryan introduces the iconic Rapture:

[i] ‘A city where the artist would not fear the censor.
Where the scientist would not be bound by petty morality.
Where the great would not be constrained by the small’ [/i]
Introducing: Bioshock. Wait, the city is in ruins. What gives?

Bioshock explores the results of a city – a world – entirely driven by a free market. In Andrew Ryan’s mind, charity, morality, ethics (and to a large extent, law) have very little place in society, and instead relies entirely on the market to dictate the world. While this would naturally lead to a sort of ‘victorian workhouse’ society, Rapture’s twist is that the city is almost entirely populated by the already materially wealthy. This leads to not just a free market psychosis, but also hedonism. Despite taking place entirely under the water, Rapture’s inhabitants have an unrelenting quench for more. 

This combination leads to obsessive drug use through a substance called “Adam” – a riff on the biblical story of Adam and Eve – which lets its user alter their DNA to gain new inhuman powers. This leads to a gruelling case of crabs in a bucket, as the city destroys itself in search of the next fix to push it towards something beyond human.

Bioshock was initially pitched to me as an Immersive sim, but I wouldn’t go quite so far. While it models its gameplay closely to System Shock, and for all we know it is in the same universe, it’s heavily stripped down mechanically. There’s no inventory management, complicated puzzles, or wandering maze-like levels. This might put off the hardcore player, who relishes in complex details and micromanagement. I know because this is me, and to an extent I do feel Bioshock is a bit *too* stripped down. Most notably there’s a lack of a stealth mechanic, which I think truly rules it out of immersive sim territory and feels like a missed opportunity. You’re railroaded into killing people, which I feel detracts from the morality of the narrative. There are also no skill trees, with character upgrades consisting solely of passive upgrades occasionally picked up over time.

Part of this did sour my enjoyment, and I had to put my expectations to one side momentarily and re-evaluate it purely as an FPS game. To those standards, it is exceptional. While the shooting is a bit floaty, and the enemies sponge bullets, the combination of elemental attacks (lightening, electricity, fire and more) alongside traditional bullets creates a fun combat loop which encourages experimentation. The first half of the game I stuck closely with the electric zap + whack combination with the lightening plasmid and wrench. However, in the second half I stuck to freezing enemies then blowing their head off with the crossbow.

The straight forwardness of Bioshock’s interface is certainly more accessible than its predecessors. This is a game anyone can pick up and play, and so some depth had to be sacrificed as a result. That being said, no other shooter will have a narrative this strong, or a world with so much environmental storytelling. Every corner there are audio tapes with their own contained storylines within levels. 

As someone with Body Dysmorphic Disorder, I really enjoyed hearing the obsessive compulsions of a woman tampering with her physical appearance with reckless abandon due to Adam. These stories are woven optionally throughout the game and tie into the levels themes and environments, with many exploring a distinctively human brand of hedonism. Whether physical looks, or artistic license, each self-indulgent greed is explored to its conclusion in Bioshock, questioning what too much of a good thing can truly be.

In terms of the remaster, I wouldn’t say the visuals are the most striking I’ve ever seen. However, I was extremely satisfied with the performance; the game didn’t drop from 60fps for a single-frame during my entire playthrough. As someone acutely aware of performance dips of any kind, even the frametimes were perfect. The achievements were well-placed throughout, and there’s directors commentary and controller input too. There’s 2K DRM, but it’s non-intrusive and doesn’t try to embed itself deep into the depths of your computer. I did have one glitch where an enemy tied to an objective didn’t spawn, which broke the game and seems to be a commonly encountered bug, which was disappointing. However, this was the only real bug I encountered (please fix!).

Overall Bioshock is a streamlined, slick entry into the, uhm, ‘shock’ series. More aimed at newcomers and mainstream audiences, Bioshock’s deep undersea world has plenty of depth in story and narrative, but is perhaps shallower in its mechanics.",True,4

In short, if you are in for a pure story driven shooter you may leave disappointed as I did, otherwise if you're looking for just fun this is definitely for you.",True,3
7670,"Important notes before I start reviewing this game: Despite this being an old game, it can still have performance issues on low-end PCs, such as low frame rate and stuttering. To get around this, I suggest going into the graphics options and turning off everything (except “Vertical Sync”, unless you’re OK with screen tearing. You can keep “Horizontal FOV Lock” on as well). Set the graphics quality and texture/actor detail to medium. I also suggest that you go to the audio options and set the audio mode to “Surround Sound”, since this game is very atmospheric, and this option will help with the immersion and also alleviate some audio problems you may encounter. If you’re experiencing issues with the sound regardless, then make sure that “Reverb” and “Creative EAX Audio” are turned off. That's pretty much it. Now, let’s begin! 

BioShock is a 2007 first-person shooter with a very unique setting: an opulent underwater city called Rapture, founded by an objectivist visionary called Andrew Ryan. You are Jack, a seemingly ordinary person who finds himself in Rapture after a plane crash. However, the supposedly wondrous paradise is not what it seems, and something has gone horribly wrong with its inhabitants. So-called “splicers” roam the city, horribly deformed and extremely violent. Much of the city is in ruin; leakage, disrepair, and destruction are all very common, among other things. With no turning back, you must venture deeper into Rapture. Collect weapons, scavenge for food, ammunition, bandages, etc. Choose from a wide variety of plasmids, serums that quite literally grant you superpowers. Upgrade your weapons as well as yourself and face off against the howling hordes of Rapture while uncovering its dark secrets. If this summary interests you, then read on. 

One aspect of BioShock I want to praise is the atmosphere and plot. I’ve already briefly mentioned it above, but I would really like to touch on it more. The game does an excellent job of creating a dystopian horror setting, where a beautiful city is crumbling, and its citizens are monsters. I loved exploring Rapture, seeing the various levels, and admiring the Art Deco style of the city. The lighting, sound design, and overall look of the game really manage to draw you in and create a decaying atmosphere. I also like the music. There are many songs from the early to mid-20th century by various artists like Django Reinhardt, Pattie Page, the Ink Spots, etc. (This game is set in 1960, so this type of music fits in perfectly). There are also tracks made specifically for the game, many of them being sombre, eerie, or straight up adrenaline-inducing. All of this music comes together to form a brilliant and fitting soundtrack for a horror game set in the early 60’s. The voice acting is excellent across the board, and I loved listening to the many tapes scattered across the game, providing an insight into the lives of Rapture citizens as well as detailing some important plot points. There’s also an amazing plot twist that I definitely don’t want to spoil.

Another aspect of BioShock I want to praise is the mechanics. I found plasmids to be very enjoyable to use, unleashing swarms of hornets upon my enemies, setting them on fire with a snap of my fingers, stunning them with bolts of electricity, etc. I’d also like to mention the gene tonics, which can make you tougher and/or stronger, allow you to obtain more health from first aid kits, make hacking easier, etc. I like these tonics, since they let the player choose from a variety of playstyles. Gene tonics and plasmids are obtained from vending machines called Gatherer’s Gardens and are purchased using ADAM, a substance that can be extracted from Little Sisters. What exactly are Little Sisters? Well, they’re young girls who collect ADAM from corpses around Rapture. They cannot attack you but are protected by powerful guardians known as Big Daddies. After killing a Big Daddy, you are given the choice of either rescuing or harvesting its accompanying Little Sister. Rescuing Little Sisters gives you less ADAM, but will warrant occasional gifts containing lots of ADAM as well as ammo, consumables, gene tonics, etc. Harvesting the Little Sisters will give you more ADAM, but you won’t receive any gifts (by the way, the ending of the game is affected by this choice). Before I move on, I want to quickly talk about hacking. You are able to hack many things in this game: turrets, security cameras, vending machines, safes, etc. The hacking in this game is done through a mini game where you have to connect a series of pipes in a way that will allow an electrical circuit to flow from one point to another. Hacking can make turrets and security bots fight for you, vending machines sell you things for lower prices, safes open, and more, so it’s very useful. One more mechanic I want to talk about is crafting. You can scavenge materials and use them to make explosives and special bullet types, among other things. 

The enemies in this game are honestly great. The most common type are the aforementioned “splicers”. There are different types of splicers in Rapture, such as acrobatic “Spider” splicers that can climb ceilings and throw hooks at you, “Leadhead” splicers that are equipped with guns, “Houdini” splicers that can turn invisible and hurl fireballs or ice shards, etc. This enemy variety helped make the combat engaging, encouraging me to switch between weapons and tactics depending on which type of splicer I was fighting against. Splicers will also run to the nearest healing station when low on health, which is a nice touch. Now I’d like to talk about the Big Daddies. There are two types in this game: Bouncers and Rosies. Bouncers are melee-focused and will aggressively charge at you in combat. Sometimes they’ll slam the ground, causing a tremor to disorient you. Rosies are range-focused and will shoot at you with their powerful rivet guns. They’ll also lob proximity mines in your direction from time to time and push you away if you get too close. The Big Daddies were genuinely fun and challenging to fight against, which encouraged me to keep killing them and reap rewards from rescuing the Little Sisters. 

I’d like to talk a bit about the weapons before I move on to the negatives. They’re mostly standard for an FPS game: you have your pistol, shotgun, machine gun, etc. Despite not being the most unique arsenal, I still enjoyed using the weapons in BioShock. All of them (except the wrench, of course) have three different ammo types that are effective against different types of foes. You can upgrade your weapons at “Power to the People” stations found across Rapture. These upgrades will make improvements including improved range and damage. What makes the upgrades even better is the fact that they change how your weapons look, which I honestly think adds charm. 

Here's where I’d like to talk about the negatives of this game. My biggest issue would definitely have to be the frame rate drops. Even after I lowered most of the graphical settings, I still experienced occasional performance issues. My PC may be pretty low-end, but a game from 2007 with lowered graphics should not be so difficult for it to run. I also experienced some odd audio issues (e.g., sound effects and voice lines being cut off and/or distorted). This mostly happened during intense gunfights, although the issue was mostly fixed by changing to the “Surround Sound” audio mode. However, I still encountered the issues regardless, albeit much less. Switching to even higher audio modes simply wasn’t an option since they wouldn’t work properly for me. I noticed some spelling errors, which isn't a big deal, but still, they were quite silly. I should also mention that the final boss is disappointing. 

In conclusion, BioShock is a highly enjoyable, atmospheric, and memorable experience. It’s not perfect, but so what?

You are fighting throught the horrors and revealing the last moments of the dead crew. Game is really wonderfull, you can really feel that winter and cold on North Pole. It's very mysterious and exciting all the time, enemies are scary and tough. From the beginning you are fighting mostly with your firsts and other melee weapons, but don't worry, guns are waiting for you. With lack of bullets and without crosshair - it's just awesome!

7850,"Interesting story, awesome effects (PhysX especially) and GREAT atmosphere, let down by bad overall graphics, super clunky combat, HORRENDOUS optimization, and the absolute worst kind of not-possible-on-the-first-try ""puzzles"".

The mechanic of ""heat is life"" is very interesting, and forces you to try to find quick ways through environments to the next heat source. You can never really die by cold, unless you're in an arctic draft or something, but standing still for too long will put you in danger of being one-shotted by enemies.

The puzzles, though. UGH, the puzzles. Don't get me wrong, some of the puzzles are very clever, and the solutions feel gratifying. Others, not so much. Several ones are not clear what you're supposed to do the first time through, and several others are just nonsensical. One puzzle in particular, the guy I was trying to save was killed by shattering glass. Once I had ""become"" him, I was forced to duck in the corner of the room to save myself. Somehow, leaving the room and closing the BULKHEAD behind me still caused me to die by glass shards. The ONLY way to win was by ducking in the corner, which happened to be underneath the window. Nonsensical.

As I mentioned in the first sentence, the atmosphere is amazing, but it seems like everything else was designed to get in the way. Aiming and timing swings in combat is an exercise in futility, feeling more like luck than anything, and there are FAR too many ""monster in the closet"" moments, where an enemy will jump out at a scripted moment (usually when you're really low on health), killing you in one hit/shot and forcing you to replay the past 5 minutes or so leading up to that moment.

I would have been inclined to actually finish the game, had ALL signs not pointed to my initial sentence. As it stands, blegh. For scary, I'll stick to Amnesia. For atmosphere, I'll stick to Bioshock. For gunplay/combat, I'll stick to any other game than this. My recommendation is avoid.",True,2

[b] What I Liked [/b]

Obviously I didn't play it long enough to really share what I liked about it.  It looked good and did what it was supposed to do, but since I didn't play it that long, I can't say what I really liked about it.

[b] What I Did Not Like [/b]

I remember this as the first Anno game I ever played.  I was clueless on what needed to be done.  I remember sailing around and just not getting what the point of the game was.

[b] Why I Stopped Playing [/b]

I tried to take this like a city builder.  It's not that simple.  None of the Anno games are.  So that's why I ended up quitting just after a couple hours.

While this game isn't on the Steam store anymore, there is a remake.  If you liked any part of the Anno series, then I recommend looking into this game.  The setting has a lot to do with it too.  I preferred the futuristic Anno games as opposed to the earlier settings.  Just a thought, as I know that impacted how much I liked each of the Anno games.

Unlike the other Cabella games on steam which usually involve open world traveling, sneaking, tracking, etc, this game just consists of 96 ( why 96 and not 100? No Idea.) hunting galleries.

You drop in random maps, shoot a few things, and hopefully score enough for a medal. Every 4 maps you pop back to the menu screen, to admire your stats and items I guess.

It's sort of a crummy mix of arcade shooting and actual hunting. For some reason, you can get bonus powerups, such as x-ray vision and bullet time, as well as a free skill that basically highlights anything shootable in the area.

You CAN move around but you move so slow and the maps are so small that there's not really much point. Which probably explains why you can't rebind your controls.

Strangely enough, and this was never explained ANYWHERE, you can pull up the unlocks menu, and equip any items in the game at a moments notice, from scents to weapon sights to pistols to shotguns.

Honestly, it is just a great game. It is not too complex like the newer manager games are.

Just pick a team, select tactics, buy players and build your team. There is a lot more to it then that but what im trying to say is this game is just so simple to pick up and play which makes it so much more enjoyable.

I find this one to be a bit harder then older CM games.  I'm one for a challenge on this type of game, so I usually start at the bottom and try to work up.  I even look into what team is in the lower leagues are considered relegation candidates.  In older games I do actually avoid relegation and do a good job on my team, however, this one seems to not be so easy going on that.

Its so hard to balance things, probably not impossible though, just I'm yet to do it.

Thankfully the game has Benefactor mode which basically throws loads of money at you and gives you an easier time, however with the catch that with so much money at your disposal, you are expected to do good.  This is the easier option for sure cus in a sense you can select who you want in your team and just buy them.  Sounds good, but dont fail.

Its a good game and a good distraction.  Hell look at my hours in xP

For £3, yeah thats a sound price if you want it.
",True,11
8060,"Championship Manager 2008 is an elderly game now and you might wonder why on earth anyone would be playing it in 2020.

Well there's a few reasons I downloaded this game - I have a lot of spare time now we are under lockdown conditions and I wanted something that would run on my 8 year old PC.  Also the price, it was and is a bargain compared to more ""modern"" games.  Plus I used to play the old Champ Manager games back in the 90s on the Amiga, so a bit of nostalgia there!

Anyway, as you can see I have played this game quite a bit, it says getting on for 2,000 hours but I do tend to leave it running, I've probably played a total of about 50 seasons or so with various teams.

I've won over a 100 trophies with Spurs, taken Gainsborough Trinity from the Conference North to the Championship in 6 seasons and then got sacked when we were relegated (tough Chairman there!) amongst other things.

Overall it's a really solid football management game, you can manage thousands of different sides from massive clubs down to small conference teams.  You have to keep an eye on finances, keep the players happy, look after training and scouting plus strategy etc.

You can do pretty much what you want, buy and sell players, train them, scout, hire staff etc.  What I like about the game is you can decide how much micro-managing you want, I personally don't bother doing the training and just buy/sell players, set contracts, pick the side and formation.  But you can do as much or little of that as you want.

The game engine is pretty believable with the highlights being decent when you consider the age of the game - it's certainly entertaining enough watching your side struggle to score goals.  One niggle is sometimes the defenders/goalkeepers do some pretty dumb things, but it's not a big issue.

What I enjoy is discovering new players when they're young and watching them develop into worldbeaters.  Picking up a non-league player at age 16 for a few thousand pounds and seeing them turn out to be multi-million pound players getting their first international cap a few seasons later.

It's certainly worth the price, I don't feel the need to get a much more expensive up to date game just at the moment.

Now excuse me as I need to get back to managing Spurs, it's 2040 and we're going to try for our fifth Premier League title in a row.

8100,"Let me explain, I have great memories of the first 4 conflict games from my childhood. I went back and played them recently and although they have their problems, they're finely crafted squad based shooters that make you think a little and manage resources (mostly in global terror). I see now why this game killed the series for good.

Just about anything you can think of that made the other conflict games great is not here. first off, they've limited the squad from 4 to 2, which makes planning as basic as setting up the sniper, and then going rambo, or putting the heavy gunner in a suppression position and sniping. This was the MAIN part of conflict that they mostly just threw out the window. the swap to first person is not aweful, but there are little to no HUD elements and things like your screen becoming red or vision blurring at certain points. I would usually applaud minimal HUD, but that's something a ""strategy"" game depends on, and before conflict would just give you information that is easy to interpret, rather than making your screen red or whatever. You also have the fact that the missions are all literally just s****y call of duty levels, where there is little choice in how you apporoach things and explosions happen everywhere. I can go on and on, but the point is this game killed a great games franchise and turned it into a co - op cod clone with squad controls that almost shouldn't be there and feel pointless.",False,92
8100,"Is it an amazing game? No. Is it worth picking up on sale? Yes. It's a pretty generic, on-rails shooter with a buddy AI. It doesn't excel, but it's worth a few dollars. Its story is also pretty much Team America: World Police, but it isn't meant to be satirical.",True,77
8100,"For a co-op oriented FPS made 10 years ago - Conflict: Denied Ops is surely not that bad, as the most of reviews for it here on Steam. In fact, I like the game. Despite all the usual stupidness of scenario, voicing, AI behavior and so on. But... the servers are closed, multiplayer is dead, and the game ain't popular (like Kane & Lynch 1/2, for example), so I doubt it's gonna get many positive marks from the new age gamers.

In Conflict: Denied Ops you play as a team of two CIA operatives, one is a Jackie Earle Haley-like marksman with SR-25, and other is big and sturdy sturmtrooper with machine gun and grenade launcher. I'm fixing on the weaponry, since there will be no guns swapping during the missions, you'll be using the same pieces again and again. Which is more, the spreading of bullets from your main guns is something really out of control. So, if you'll try to play the game, you'll might end up like me, with picking everything with the pistol shots, thanks to the lower spreading of this weapon. Other than that, there are plenty of red barrels over all levels, to make the game more Michael Bay-like. And... there are silencers, to play (optionally) some levels ninja-style, for extra challenge of patience.

The story is obviously the weakest point of the game, with the US invading Venezuela (due to some political power crisis), some african compounds and even polar Russia (killing bad russians making nukes and optionally helping some good russians). The voicing is bad, the dialog lines even worse. On the bright side, the video inserts between the levels are well made... for what it's worth.

Overall, the value of the game is limited by your patience for aged on-rail FPS games with somewhat unstandard mechanic. You might like it, you might not. The game isn't really a hidden gem you'll be missing. On the other side, there are not too many co-op oriented shooters which are still kicking, so, as one of them, I'll mark Conflict: Denied Ops with 5.8/10 and positive vote. You might get it as a part of some bundle, but, I don't think  that you need to really go hunting for this game in your library.",True,44

The two character's cultures clash as the black guy repeatedly calls the white guy hick, who, in return always shows dissapointment in his partner's actions. Okay so I played the first level and half of the second one, the game was going nowhere quick and with only 4 weapons to play around with, I was done. Uninteresting, uninspired. I'm sure in the final two levels, the two characters will have formed a strong bond because of the shit they've seen. Hell may have broke Luce Tom Waitts, but not these guys. In the end I'm sure when the black guy calls the white guy hick, it will be out of respect and he'll get respect back. Seriously, other than stupid writing there's nothing to talk about.

8100,"First off, I recommend this only on basis of having played it in singleplayer, I couldn't get the co-op mode to work with my friend (it might be possible locally, but I'm fairly sure the online service it used has been shut down permanently).

The story is all in all kinda meh, and very generic. But the gameplay differs somewhat from most other shooters, it has a bit of a Delta Force feel to it at times, even though the player characters sometimes seem like the clumsiest motherfuckers around. It can be a frustrating game to play, because you can die very quickly, through no real fault of your own - but being very aware helps, the enemies tend to circle around and try to outflank you, which is made possible by level designs that are sometimes much more diverse and maze-like than what is the norm for the genre.

The graphics and sound are unimpressive, but not downright bad either, it does the trick well for people who are more gameplay-oriented.

Pros

-Nice details, destruction is pretty nice (cover, debris etc), some magazines fall to the floor also footprints in the snow. Leaning while nice, is a bit over the top.
-Swap between characters for different loadouts
-Order squadmate to attack, defend regroup to an area or target, not common in fps arcade shooters 
-Guns don't always shoot in the same pattern , i'd call it a 'Simcade shooter'
-Choose missions/operations to play in any order.
-If a squad mate goes down, you have to revive them in 2 minutes or they die, if both die then you fail the mission. This adds a bit of challenge on higher difficulties.

Cons

-Aiming is clunky, take far to long to zoom in.
-General Story plot is a bit generic, (mission progression structure is not bad though)
-Voice acting is not the best, though its not the worst, just mediocre.
-Enemy corpse cleanup takes a long time, making the aftermath of battles more effectively realistic.
-Soundtrack is very repetative and 'action based epic genre', just seems to loop in the background even when there is no action. feels out of place.
-Enemy weapons cannot be picked up.
-Poor ai cell spawns. Enemies can often spawn behind or in front of the player, getting them killed instantly if they are climbing ladders/interacting with objects.
-No Sprint option, can be a little derpy if caught out in the open, trying to move to cover getting hit repeatedly.
-Dmr weapon has no steady aim option making it essentially useless unless hip-firing it at medium range or getting lucky at long range. not sure what they were thinking with the WEAPON SWAY scope wildly shifting across the screen like the guy has been running a 1 mile marathon.
-Poor weapon variety for story mode. plenty of enemy weapon variety, but player can't use them?

Summery
Overall an interesting idea, combining sim elements you'd find in shooter like arma, order squad around with leaning elements for tactical gameplay with action elements like destruction make for some fun and immersion, however it falls short of anything unique in the story and voice acting department limiting any potential that could have set it apart from the rest.
The story has a poor overall plot, but the mission structure with comedy that sometimes works makes for an enjoyable if limited, experience.
I like how a team chopper will sometimes assist you in battle, making you feel part of a military force, while not a big force it does make battles more thrilling and realistic.
I would be interesting to see a modern take on this game (simcade) style as i think it could open new doors for exciting but far reaching (audience wise) drive.

Worth a try if on sale, not terrible by any means, but certainly not the best either, a just-above-average military shooter with some interesting mechanics to boot.

8140,"Tomb Raider: Underworld is a competent if anti-climatic finale to the second phase of Tomb Raider, a shame as several levels and scenarios are very well made, massively upping the scale from both Legend and Anniversary. The Mexico and and Jan Mayen island chapters offer some great climbing puzzles mixed in with Lara's motorbike, giving a glimpse of where the franchise could have gone if it hadn't been rebooted in 2013. These levels are backed up by great graphical detail, though the occasional glitch on PC does creep in. (Guides recommend turning on V-Sync and other settings to fix them)

Where Underworld falls down is with its sluggish combat and underwhelming story; Lara moves slower than she did in the previous two games and the plot, despite having a fair bit of build-up, doesn't deliver much impact. On top of that, the two DLC episodes that added an epilogue of sorts are not present as they remain exclusive to Xbox to this day.

Most of it revolves around parodying mid-2000s TV, which is probably the closest Sam & Max humor has ever gotten to a specific point in time and thus the risk of being dated, or of missing the mark if you're not familiar with crappy shows like The Big Bang Theory.

While Sybil has switched from being a psycho-analyst to a tabloid paper publisher, in this case the the tabloid is called the ""Alien Love Triangle"". When Sam and Max received a call from the commissioner on a new case, it looks like a new celebrity has gone rogue. This time its talk show host Myra Stump, who is holding her audience against their will at the TV studio ""WARP TV"".

So Sam and Max head to the studio to arrest the crazed Myra on site and free the hostages. But the Freelance Police themselves can't even enter through the doorway of Myra's show unless they are celebrities that are worth inviting onto the show. The only way to put a stop to the talk show crisis is by winning a game show hosted by the zealous Hugh Bliss, receive a record deal from a singing contest being judge by two of the Soda Poppers, and being casted on a sitcom with the guidance of a no nonsense TV director woman whose name was never mentioned.

In order to find out the truth behind such a power struggle, as well as maintain their own innocence and safety, they set out to investigate all the events surrounding the ""Vacant Lot"" incident. In Kamurocho, Sam is suspected of murder after the man that he has collected money from winds up dead in a piece of real estate that is hotly contested. Sam's boss, Sohei Dojima, offers a promotion to second-in-command of the Dojima Family to whomever can find the deed to the land and thus the most ruthless members go after Sam. On the run, Sam must prove his innocence thus keeping his foster father from facing retribution for introducing him into the clan. In Osaka, Max runs a cabaret club after being exiled from the Tojo Clan due to the Ueno-Seiwa hit years earlier. Despite his club being highly successful, he realizes it's nothing more than cage as he's under constant surveillance. One day, he's offered the chance to redeem himself by assassinating a target.

At the time of Sam & Max 103, Sam is 20 years old and is working as a debt collector for the Dojima Family. The main plot of the game is triggered by the murder of a man in the Empty Lot. Because Sam had recently collected a debt from this man, Keiji Shibusawa, Daisaku Kuze, and Hiroki Awano (the three Lieutenants of the Dojima Family, and therefore Sam's superiors) blame him for the murder.

Reality 2.0 is one of the standout episodes of Season One for me, partly because it's a self-aware adventure game full of video game jokes.

Perhaps due to that, the puzzle design is more repetitive and has more trial-and-error than the previous episode, but some of the other puzzles are still pretty inspired. I also didn't like the COPS song as much as I did other episodes' featured songs; maybe it's just me, but I found it a bit annoying.

The game takes place not too long after Sam & Max successfully shut down the internet, but unsuccessful in aprehending the mastermind behind the hypnotizing devices that they've been encountering since the Brady Culture case. The only clue they got from the Reality 2.0 case is the mastermind's name being ""Roy E. Biv"". Upon pondering the name it didn't took our Freelance Police long to figure out that ""Roy E. Biv"" is an alias for Hugh Bliss the eccentric prismatologist who happens to be the very man they were after the whole time. His whereabouts is on the moon where he has a prismatology brotherhood center that is made up of members that are either friends or former enemies of Sam & Max. The moon in the Sam & Max universe has an atmosphere  so no need for spacesuits to breathe. Much like in the animated TV series where the duo previously made their trip. In order to infultrate this establishment, Sam & Max must get the usual help from Sybil who is now the ""Queen of Canada"" and Bosco who is either out of his mind or is just confused about his gender at the moment. This game is a good conclusion to the first season of Telltale Games' Sam & Max series.

In this chapter, the master schemer is revealed to be Hugh Bliss, and Sam and Max are tasked with stopping him from putting all of mankind under a hypnotic trance. In order to do that, they simply take their car and somehow find a way to travel to the moon

They get to meet various characters from previous chapters in there, so not only it doesn't seem to be a problem to get to the moon, but I guess it's also a cool place to chill out

In this final chapter, Bosco dresses like a woman and assumes the role of a mom. His latest gadget is naturally absurdly expensive, and it's meant to cause earthquakes. Sybil, on the other hand, is now the queen of Canada (props to her for never giving up her modus operandi)

The episode blends elements of sci-fi and fantasy while maintaining its comedic style. I thought that some of the puzzles were a bit challenging, but that I guess I just didn't have enough imagination to deal with them

Even back at the street the usual characters aren't doing much exciting. Dialogue is underwhelming too, with a lot of jokes being used multiple times. 

Episode 2 of Season 1 was frustrating, but still had an interesting script with amusing side content, something this entry could have used.

It adds nothing to the season overall and ends up painfully mediocre.",False,5

Anyway, this episode is decent, with its major highlight being a bevy of good writing that shows Sam & Max at its most humorously cruel. The setting is also fittingly outlandish, but that's a trait the whole season has, so the credit for that ought to be applied to all five games more than any individual one. Ingenious portal-based puzzles balance out the rote Monkey Island-style 'complete three tasks' section in the latter half of the game, but they can't entirely make up for the higher-than-usual puzzle difficulty combining with the relative lack of thematic cohesion on display.

It's perhaps the weakest episode of Season Two, mainly by virtue of being okay rather than great like the others - in particular, the aforementioned outlandish setting of Easter Island isn't utilized quite as well as one would hope. As an aside, the original Portal came out a couple of months before this game, so it certainly looks like Telltale took some inspiration if you know what I mean.

Some of the puzzles here in Episode Three are good, but others can prove a bit frustrating. They're some of the hardest of all the Telltale Sam & Max games up to this point, at least for me. When I replayed them at the time of these reviews, this game marked the first time I had to look in the community guides for advice. The difficulty here has less to do with lack of thematic cohesion like with the preceding episode (which was also on the relatively difficult side) and more with the fact that there's more trial-and-error than usual here, and in at least a couple of puzzles you absolutely must be observant of the environment. Compared to the rest of the genre, it's still lenient, but if you're playing these one after the other you'll need to step up your puzzle game.

As befitting a Sam & Max game, the writing's pretty good. It has the usual humor, but there's also a couple interesting twists this time around, the ending leads nicely into the next episode, and overall it's thematically consistent with its pisstake of classic horror. However, I felt the Sybil mini-arc was a bit bland, even if it did provide plot development for her. I also have mixed feelings about the villain: on one hand his personality does a great job of motivating you to defeat him, but on the other hand I feel it's a bit out of character for Sam & Max to repeatedly poke fun at metrosexuals, even if the one they're making fun of is also a dastardly European vampire. It's still bizarre enough to work, but it felt a bit out of place to me. Then again, after over two dozen comics, games, and even a TV cartoon, I can forgive the odd writing misfire.

(The other reviews DO mention it, so, uh, be careful if you want to go in totally unspoiled.) This episode is when the overarching plot arc of the whole season starts coming together, but if you were observant in previous games you may be able to guess who's behind everything, unlike Season One where the ultimate antagonist kind of came out of nowhere.

Something to point out is that this episode's writing is especially witty, with plenty of callbacks - some of which actually contribute to the plot - although it's rather heavy on the dialogue in the first half. That doesn't get in the way of the episode's puzzles, which are overall the best balanced in all the Telltale Sam & Max games: not too obvious, but not overly reliant on trial-and-error, with lateral thinking taking precedent.

It's the longest episode yet, or at least it feels like it, which is fitting considering the true villains are revealed in the last third. I don't really have any major complaints about it; even when the 'complete three tasks to advance' trope appears near the end, the quality is enough to make up for any lack of originality - although given that it's supposed to be a climactic showdown against evil forces, I suppose the game could have gone a bit farther than a standard formula before the 'boss fight'.

Negatives: It's tedious and boring, making it feel much longer than the short runtime.

'Bone' is one of my favorite books (graphic or otherwise) ever.  It's a wonderful fantasy adventure.  I also enjoy TellTale's games (though they aren't perfect).  So I should love this, right?  I wish. 

Every task you're asked to complete is clearly busy work.  None of the ""puzzles"" is truly driven by the story.  They're just hoops to jump through in order to get to the next screen.  The worst offender is when you're asked to guide Ted the bug across the river.  Without a walkthrough, I never would have gotten across as the logic dicated by the pattern of his jumps breaks down when you get close to the other side.  It looks like I should be able to make the jumps necessary as the stones are spaced just like rest, and I tried multiple spots to lead from, but there is only one single way to get across, and if you don't follow it, it won't allow you to make the jumps.

An additional crime, less painful but still aggravating, is the inability to skip voiced dialogue.  I can generally read the text much faster than the voice actor will deliver it, and when I'm in the middle of an extended Q&A, I want to get it over with as soon as possible.  But perhaps that's my impatience with the overall game.  I just wanted to be done and wished I could speed up any little bit of it.  This lack of skipability carries over into the end credits.  They're slowly scrolled and, for some heinous reason, quadruple spaced.  And you... can't... skip them.

To be fair, the early sections of the book are relatively uneventful, but maybe that should have been a sign to TellTale.  'Bone' would make a phenomenal animated movie, but videogames are an interactive medium, and that interaction needs to feel meaningful.  The source material here, as much as I love it, doesn't bear the weight of player interaction.

The minigames can be skipped if anyone finds them too difficult. It's not a great game, but it's not terrible either. Others have mentioned bugs, but apart from two moments of silence when characters should have been speaking, I didn't encounter any.

The pace of the game is quite slow, characters move ponderously and dialogue can't be skipped. For a point and click adventure there aren't that many things to click on. There are very few objects to find and even fewer puzzles that require using those objects. The game is mainly dialogue driven with lots of talking and is very linear, interspersed with set piece games and puzzles. These are quite simplistic and frankly I found them rather tedious, although kids would probably enjoy them.

I would not recommend this game for adults, but I would recommend it for the audience it was clearly intended for, young children.

Sadly, Telltale did not live up to the comic with this game.

Firstly, it is a point-and-click game. While in theory this would work in favour, there is just not enough to observe in the enviorments. It's a rather empty game, lacking in atmosphere and inspiration. The dull voice-acting doesn't help at all. There are several moments where the game transitions to a sort-of ""mini-game"" mode, and these segments do not work at all.

The dialogue is even slower then the first, and the ""mini-games"" get you stuck it sucks so much a*s it made be quit.
Would not bother with this crap.

8320,"This game is far better than the first one. It's bigger, with more difficult puzzles (compared to ones in the first game), and has some fascinating missions. I really love the voice acting and the dialogues. Still, I love the Bone games, mostly because I love the Bone comics too. I feel like I forced myself to like these games. So, I'm not sure if everyone is going to love these games. Sadly, Telltale Games abandoned the Bone game series and they are left without a third game, so they're incomplete. With their current experience, Telltale Games would make an excellent third Bone game, so I really hope they will consider it.",True,8
8320,Bone: The Great Cow Race is the sequel to Bone Out from Boneville and follows on Phone Bone and the gang as theyre being hunted by the Locust yet again but will this sequel top the first one or will you want to skip it ? This time you play as all three cousins instead of the two you played in the first one. The game picks up a little before the first episode ends where we find out how the guys ended up in the city. After escaping from the locust we find out that Grandma Ben's farm house has been destroyed they set onto compete in the Great cow race. While Phone bone tries to impress Thorn. Phoney and Smiley hatched a plan to win the Race for themselfs and take the bet winnings while we find out that the locust are still trying to catch and kill Phone Bone. So how is the sequel ? Overall i liked this more than the first act since i liked the puzzles more in this one cause they were a bit tougher to figure out.  The gameplay is still the same as the first one but this time you can switch to witch charecter you want to play on the fly. The script is funny and the game is very fun. But there are a few problems with the game. Its quite short and the biggest turn off for some people im gonna try to avoid spoiling it here but the game ends on a cliffhanger which is never resolved (unless youve read the comic books) Overall this is a very fun adventure game. Definetly get both episodes of Bone cause its really fun. I give Bone: The Great Cow Race a 8/10,True,4
8320,"Played March 2016. 4 hours, but I accidentily left it running on pause awhile. It is probably only 2 hours of gameplay.  This game has a similar glitch that prevents running on Windows 10, but search the community board and you can find the workaround, and it is similar to the workaround for the first Bone game. (Delete a file, start the game, change settings, restart the game).

[h1] Do you like Bone? Do you like Telltale style games?[/h1]

If you like either of them, it might be a buy. But it's certainly not mandatory for fans of the Bone series. 

It's the sequel to the first Bone game. It's a Telltale point-and-click adventure. I'm not a big fan of that style of game, but I love Bone.

It still has decent character models that look like the books. This game doesn't change the book, but it adds a lot. The gist is you have to help Fone through the fair to collect honey for Thorn, you have to help Smiley build the cow suit, and you have to help Phoney convince people to bet on the mystery cow. So most of the content is not in the book, but many of the bigger gags from the book make it to the game. 

Some of the voice acting grew on my after the first game. It's not good, but Smily and Phoney felt ok. The animation acting was usually poor. The puzzles aren't very good, and sometimes I had the annoying, ""I know what do to, how to I get the game to let me do that,"" frustration that can come with this type of game. But there is a hint button that will help.

8320,"I have a few things to say about this game and the previous game, Bone : Out from Boneville.

So first of all, it has been brought to my attention people have been giving this game POSITIVE REVIEWS, and I know that it was one of their first games and their team probably wasn't experienced, and I'm not expecting a miracle out of a new company, because I have a brain. But this game is so exceedingly bad, even for a company that just is starting out, and I'm gonna say why, especially since this game isn't available anymore.

First, there's the graphics. This game is garbage looking, and there's no doubt, I mean this game came out the same year as Resident Evil 4, which is amazing for its time, sure, but if you compare the graphics that was what was capable in 2005, in fact resident evil CAME FIRST, and I know its a cartoon style, but its just bad, and it hurts my eyes. The color palette is toilet, its just a lot of brown and red and white and grey, that's not even a joke, that's the best way I can describe it, it's really that bad. The animations are just as bad, the mouths move like the worst lipsync in the world, I honestly got a good laugh out of that. Overall though it's really just ugly, and is an aspect that makes this game awful.

The gameplay is just so bad. It's a story-based game right, so it's not supposed to be super duper fun, but most RPG story games have the minigames or QTE's or something, but oh boy bone is something else. The games have strange mechanic where you have to figure out some bull method of winning like a puzzle, but it's a minigame? I actually don't get it, like in the first game you had to figure out this hide and seek game that took about an hour for me to realize that saying warmer and colder moves them in the direction (spoiler alert lol). Another amazing thing, although I enjoy Fone crip walking everywhere, it's so damn slow, and it takes ages to go everywhere, and I'm not joking about the crip walk, buying the game just for that is reasonable.

Finally, I will talk about the best part of the game, the dialogue. Now it's a story-based RPG, so the dialogue should be pretty good, and it's fine for the most part since it's ripped from the book, but first the voice acting is wooden most of the time and is god awful in general. The thing about the dialogue is that some of it is written by the game writers or whatever, and you can tell which are ripped from the book because the lines written by the programmers or whatever is so bad, you can tell it apart easily. It's not completely bad, but wow is it far off from the normal game writing.

Now this is written with a ton of hyperbole, and I actually enjoyed playing this game with friends since it's so funny and we just laughed for hours about some of the dumb things in this game, but that doesn't change that I still did technically enjoy it. And like I said, this game came out when Telltale was still a fresh company, so you can't judge this too harshly or use this to define the company.

In conclusion, play these games, you will hate them and yourself, but you will laugh your ass off.
But actually don't get these, these are better lost to time.",False,2
8320,"Being a fan of the book series by Jeff Smith and the first game of the series (Bone: Out From Boneville) I definitely liked the second one better. If you would like to see my review of the first one, go check the store and my review is there somewhere. This one is more difficult than the first one. Now, I cheated in this one. I used the help button throughout, making it only take me three hours to beat. Now, if yoiu don't use it, and have never played it, it should take you longer to beat it than the first one. Unlike the first one, this one has more difficulty and problem-solving skills. It even has the possibility of playing as Smiley Bone, as well as Fone Bone and Phoney Bone. In the first game, you couldn't switch between characters whenever you wanted to and you couldn't play as Smiley Bone. The thing about this is that every character you play as is connected in some way. So, when you do a certain thing with one character, it makes it help one of the other characters. When you are finished doing everything possible with one character, you are unable to use that character anymore, so that it makes it simpler for you to know what to do next. The mini games are minimal in this game, unlike the first one, and concentrates more on problem solving. It is much more entertaining than the first one, much more difficult, and much longer (if you don't use the help button). I recommend this game and I give it 9 out of 10.

8400,"[h1]Bomb Voyage.[/h1]
Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved is a PC port of the seminal Xbox 360 launch title, presented to a (potentially) new audience. While the premise of the game is simple (destroy everything on screen and don't get hit), it becomes challenging as well as infuriating later on - but in the best way.

In many ways, Geometry Wars is a throwback to traditional arcade titles and encompasses the best of them in many ways: you fight various different enemies, each with their own mechanics, and is designed as a twin-stick shooter at heart; your experience will likely be much better with a controller, but it is also playable with a mouse and keyboard. You earn lives and bombs at set points in the scoring process, with the game ending when your lives are over. It sounds simple, and it is - but easy, it is not (or at least not for me). The mechanics are also quite straightforward, but also deceptively tricky; things seem to happen at random (e.g. certain enemies spawning at random points, no pattern in terms of what comes next etc.) which keeps it fresh and challenging, while providing an opportunity for skilled players to differentiate themselves from the rest of the crop.

If you are looking for deep, meaningful gameplay and an engaging story - this is not it. If you are looking for something easy to pick up, tricky to master, as well as addicting, Geometry Wars may well fit the bill. Sadly, leaderboards are missing which does detract from the longevity (for some), but it does not take away from what is a fantastic title.

[b]Currently the MOST EXPENSIVE monthly-subscription based MMO out there.[/b]

Regional pricing ONLY FOR OMEGA when?
I don’t care about any item in-game that can be bought with real money (PLEX, Boosters, etc) CCP can definitely keep this other stuff out of regional pricing, since I’m not interested in it and never will be, I only care about the subscription which is called Omega and won’t affect the economy in-game, and that’s what really have the potential to keep new players out of the game with the current price.

Omega cost in Steam is R$107 in my country Brazil (around US$21) half the price of a triple AAA game (which is around R$200) for a monthly subscription, and more expensive than the US$20 if I bought it directly from the website. While in Argentina Omega costs around US$10.
https://steamdb.info/app/695740/

Now comparing to other MMOs and Streaming Services:

Runescape - R$ 27 / US$12.5 (Very Acceptable)
World of Warcraft - R$33 / US$15 (Acceptable)
WarThunder - R$40 / US$ ? (Acceptable)
The Elder Scrolls Online - R$ 55 / US$ 15 (Kind of Expensive)
Final Fantasy - R$ ? / US$ 15 (Too Expensive)
Eve Online - R$ 107 / US$20 (Extremely Expensive)

Netflix - R$26
Amazon PrimeVideo - R$15
DisneyPlus - R$28

Subscriptions/Memberships shouldn’t be above R$30 in my country, otherwise people think its not worth it.
If the price for Omega was around R$30, I would spend like R$120 to activate my 4 accounts without a problem, but paying R$107 for a single account? HELL NO!

CCP YOU ARE LOSING POTENTIAL PLAYERS!",False,22
8500,"I tried. I really did. I tried on multiple occasions over the course of many years. And this time, I got very close- I got the most involved with the game than I had ever been. I learned more. I cared about the well-being of my corporation and the friends I had made in this game. I honestly thought I’d be playing this game for many, many more years. I had even gotten my wife into the game!

But let me tell you- if you’ve heard all the amazing stories of what this game could be: the epic wars, battles involving hundreds of players, millions of ISK lost in betrayals: those days are long gone. Much as people will say that we were born too late to explore the Earth, and too early to explore Space, we are all too late to explore the peak of what Eve: Online was. And maybe we’re still too early to experience what Eve: Online could one day be.

All that’s left, then, is the core gameplay. And the bad news: the core gameplay is dreadfully boring. And as I and all the friends I had made slowly started to realize this (including, eventually, our CEO), we started dropping out of the game one by one. We all had said our goodbyes to ship-spinning, staring at our screens, waiting in Discord for anything to happen, mind-numbing mission grinding, and mobile-game levels of predatory monetization. Darn.

But what do I mean when I say the gameplay is boring?

Well, let’s take traveling, for example. Traveling from one location in the galaxy to another takes a lot of time. To be honest, this is something I think is a super cool aspect of the game and it’s part of what makes it so grand, and it facilitates the economy since items will have different prices in different parts of the galaxy. However, we’ve all played games where it can take a while to travel from one part of the map to another. In a game like Red Dead Redemption, for example, it’s a relaxing and zen experience just jumping on your horse and riding to a new location. There’s stuff to do on the way, and you’re engaged most of the time. Maybe a better example would be a game like American Truck Simulator (which is comparable seeing as how both games have you hauling stuff a great deal). In ATS, they managed to make just traveling from one location a great time. And this makes sense since this is going to be a LOT of what you’ll be doing.

In Eve: Online, you right-click from gate to gate and wait as you watch your ship go through its warp animations. It is mind-numbing, tedious, and it will take out a sizeable amount of your time. The only decisions you’ll ever get to make are whether to jump through a gate because you think it might be getting camped, which only means your trip is going to take longer. Some of these trips could take up to half an hour at a time. The game also gives you the option to auto-pilot, so you don’t have to deal with the tedium that is clicking on a menu every 15-30 seconds. But, of course, the cost of this is that your trip will take CONSIDERABLY more time if you do (which makes no sense… why would a computer be less accurate with its warps than a person)?

Waiting and staring at your screen is this game’s core mechanic. Let’s look at another example: mining. Again, think about any game where you enjoyed mining. Mining can be a pleasant and relaxing experience all on its own. In Eve: Online, you right-click on a rock and just… wait. Again. For ages. No option even for a more actively engaging version of mining. Just stare at a pretty laser or gas cloud harvester for 30 minutes until you fill up, dock, drop off your rocks and repeat.

At least mining manages to be the perfect activity to do if you want to play a game passively while you do something like homework… except, no. Because of course, this is Eve, and you can still get ganked at any time. If you’re in high sec, this is far less likely, but there are players whose very existence is dedicated to destroying AFK miners. And if you’re trying to mine somewhere else such as lowsec, nullsec, or a wormhole… well then you don’t even get to enjoy doing homework because you’re there spamming the directional scanner the whole time to make sure you won’t get randomly attacked.

I want to make it clear that I’m not criticizing the open PVP of this game. That part is brilliant, and I’ll always love it. What I’m criticizing is just how boring doing some of the most basic stuff in this game can be: stuff that you’ll likely be doing a lot of.

This review is going to go on forever if I go this deep into everything wrong with Eve: Online, so I’m just going to mention a few more things:

- Joining corporations in this game sucks. Thanks to the early exploits and betrayals of players from a bygone age, trying to join a fun corporation can feel like applying for a real-life job. And many of these corporations still use old annoying third-party software like Mumble or Teamspeak, along with their own personal websites.

- The PvE missions in this game are extremely grindy and very boring. The industry missions literally just have you hauling stuff or mining stuff for NPCs, and we’ve already discussed how mind-numbing those activities can be. But even the combat missions were extremely dull. A friend and I tried to grind reputation so we could do any Epic Arc in null sec, and by the time we finally got the reputation we needed, we were ready to smack our heads into our computer screens just to feel something again. It might have helped if we could properly “party up” in the missions. We were doing them together, but we still had our own separate missions and the rewards had to be split 50/50 which means doing them together didn’t make the missions go any faster and didn’t make them any more excited because the missions don’t scale with the number of players.

- The experience in this game is gained in real-time, even when you’re offline. I always thought this was a cool mechanic, but it does mean you’re going to feel useless as a new player for a LONG time. So much of the early game will be focused on all the many things you can’t do. There is a solution to this, in a game that already costs $20 a month for a premium subscription, is that you can buy more skill points to speed up your development. This makes the game feel like a straight-up mobile experience that you’re paying a premium for to play in the first place.

I’m getting tired of writing, so I’m just going to list a couple of things I still like about Eve: Online. Exploration is still fun, but it’s very lonely. I wish other activities had as much effort put effort into them as the scanning, but even that does begin to feel samey and boring after a while. I also still love the core ideas of Eve: Online- the completely open and free trade/economy, and the open PVP. Also, the game’s pretty, which is impressive given how old it is now.

People will often say that Eve: Online is only as fun as you make it. Well, I tried. I went out looking for more exciting things to do beyond mining and hauling. I tried PvE, PvP, Epic Arcs, and more. And no matter what the activity, they all gave me a very similar feeling: that is, I always felt like I was just waiting around for something more interesting to happen, and maybe sometime cooler could happen if I only had more skill points. And even though there were some fun and exciting moments, they weren’t even close to worth the amount of time and boredom I had endured to reach them.

I honestly don’t believe any number of updates could make Eve: Online a fun game nowadays. This game needs a fundamental rework of many of its core mechanics. What we need is the future that we are here too early to explore, Eve: Online 2, which could maybe take notes from other games that have manages to make traveling in spaceships fun, mining space rocks fun, and doing PvE missions with your friend’s fun, and so on. Until then, Eve: Online will remain an excellent MMO, but a mediocre game.",False,12

Autobobilista took the sim racing up a notch while Assetto Corsa went up on presentation, content and graphics but down on car physics and AI racing quality.  So I decided to try another old Simbin product and got Race 07 with this and other expansion packs and so far they are soo good.

Pro's: 
Driving Physics
Cost
Content
Quality of AI, they race hard but clean, they improved what was lacking in GTR2.
You can very quickly set the FFB, steering etc and it works.  I spent weeks adjusting settings in Assetto Corsa till I got it acceptable.
Much smaller file sizes to download.

It may not have the latest graphics, but with a little tuning it looks like good simulator with crisp functional graphics.
Certainly one of my favorite racing games.

My son got this game for from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

8870,"Bioshock Infinite is a game that is truly deserving of all the praise it has received. It's a game that manages to perfectly balance incredible storytelling, immersive world-building, and captivating gameplay into one seamless experience.

From the moment you step into the city of Columbia, you are immediately drawn into its stunningly realized world. The attention to detail in every corner of the city is simply breathtaking, from the gorgeous architecture to the hauntingly beautiful soundtrack.

But what really sets Bioshock Infinite apart is its incredible storytelling. The game's plot is masterfully crafted, and the characters you encounter along the way are some of the most memorable and well-developed in all of gaming.

But it's not just the story that makes Bioshock Infinite so great. The gameplay is equally impressive, with a wide variety of weapons and abilities that make every encounter feel fresh and exciting. The game also features some of the most creative and inventive set pieces I've ever seen, with moments that will leave you on the edge of your seat.

And perhaps what I love most about Bioshock Infinite is its ability to tackle deep and thought-provoking themes, such as racism, religion, and the nature of reality itself. These themes are woven seamlessly into the game's narrative, and they serve to make the experience all the more impactful and unforgettable.

Overall, Bioshock Infinite is a game that truly deserves to be played and experienced by anyone who loves gaming. It's a game that manages to balance incredible storytelling with captivating gameplay in a way that few other games can match. It's a game that I will always hold dear, and one that I would recommend to anyone looking for an unforgettable gaming experience.",True,4

8870,Literally the best Videogame in terms of story.,True,3
8870,"This entire game could have just simply be a Netflix limited run or a movie. As a game, it's...playable, sometimes enjoyable. You shoot things, you move forward, you use abilities etc. But it's not a Bioshock game. I don't bemoan the lack of RPG aspects (Bioshock was terrible as an RPG) but there's something overly on-the-rails about Infinite that I feel suffocating. This in comparison to the slow exploration and dread within the original Bioshock and even the System Shock games that inspired it. There's a large dissonance between gameplay and plot, and I feel like half of the time I'm playing in service of the plot. The gameplay is not varied nor does it give me much options to approach. It literally plays like a run of the mill shooter. And then the story itself is not really that engaging as a videogame. You have no choices nor ability to impact the story. 

Games should really excel in one or the other - give me very good and tight gameplay that's enjoyable to go through and I could care less about plot (Sekiro, or Skyrim, or Resident Evil games), or give me a way to impact the plot and I'll slog through even the most dull gameplay (Witcher 3, Disco Elysium, etc). Infinite doesn't work because the gameplay is dull and the plot is linear. It feels like going through a Call-of-Duty campaign. I would commend the writing, which is interesting and engaging. It's just that all this could have been told through a movie or a TV series, where I would not have to slog through playing it. 

Obviously this is my personal opinion, and a lot of people have a lot of praise for 'games that are good movies' like the Last of Us. Honestly, I would give one caveat to this: I loved Uncharted as games. But that's because I always watched Indiana Jones and thought 'damn I wish I could play through that action set-piece'.  But Infinite just doesn't do it for me.",False,3

8870,"The introduction of a Multiverse is a bold move that many franchises have start making back in the day however those can back fire as time goes on. At the start Infinite was praised but as time when on it became sort of a bittersweet and confusing end for the Bioshock IP. With the gameplay just being a modernized version of 2's the story is kind of same.  With the game explaining to many things and trying to be it's own thing and a prequel to the original Bioshock it just ends up being a confusingly fun experiences.

8890,"A 4-hero bird's-eye-view Real-Time Strategy game where you fight the forces of evil over a series of discrete missions.

THE GOOD
- This game is surprisingly fun.
- There's a rock-paper-scissors aspect to super-heroes, and it can be fun to find good team synergies and figure out how to defeat enemies.
- The graphics are surprisingly good for a classic game, still perfectly acceptable by modern indie-game standards.
- The story is pretty standard 4-colour comic book nonsense. This might be good or bad depending on your taste!
- It's fun to create your own custom super-heroes. Be careful, though, because if they are too powerful it can ruin the fun of the game by making it too easy.

THE BAD
- If the depiction of Nazis and other enemies of the USA during/after WWII might offend you (and the depictions are very stereotypical!), you should probably take a hard pass on this game.
- The heroes are a bit dumb, requiring a lot of micro-management. Unless you give them a direct order they sit around doing nothing. Any abilities with an energy cost will only activate once. Anytime they get stunned or whatnot, they stop what they were doing. So you need to babysit all 4 of them and constantly monitor them to make sure they are behaving correctly. This is mitigated somewhat by just getting used to doing it reflexively over time.

THE UGLY
- The game is overall very polished--there aren't many bugs to speak of.
- There was one mission where a character had to prepare a device, and it wasn't immediately obvious how to do this. They probably could have explained it a bit better. You actually have to right click on them and use an ability they don't normally have.
- Characters can sometimes get stuck on obstacles when trying to move. Particularly annoying if you told them to move a long distance and then panned away to deal with something else.
- The game crashed on me once, and I lost about 30 minutes of play time.",True,10

Borderlands: The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned is a quick play through, generally lasting an extra 4 or 5 hours added to the game. As is the theme with borderlands content... the references, humor, story, combat and gameplay are excellent. One final thing to note is the release date, The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned was released in 2009, so it has aged, but I feel that it's aged just as well as the borderlands core game.

[b][u]-Detailed breakdown review-[/u][/b]
Story: What a spooky place we've traveled to this time Vault Hunter, I don't think we're in Kansas anymore! This DLC looks like it was refurbished based on Halloween town.... in other words IT LOOKS AWESOME. Some mad Doctor is running around causing a zombie epidemic, but make sure you don't blame Dr. Zed, because it's definitely not Dr.Zed... 

[b]Gameplay:[/b] Because of Dr.Ned's Antics the most common NPC you'll be fighting will be zombies, these mindless undead are just as charming to blow up as they are in any other game. To be honest the gameplay doesn't really change much at all... The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned does what a DLC should: extends the game.

[b]Achievements:[/b] There are 5 achievements you gain access too with this DLC, you cannot get 100% completion without this DLC. The Achievements are all straight forward... there's only one achievement that will require a bit of grinding, but it depends on how well you juggle quest-turn-in's.... it might take more or less time.


[b]Price:[/b] Borderlands: The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned is priced at $9.99. If you want to show support for the franchise you could buy it at that price, I happen to be rather thrifty and don't have much excessive money, so I would recommend buying the Game of the Year Edition of Borderlands, or waiting for a 75% off sale (or better, or both) Since this DLC is rather dated your chances at getting a good sale is very likely.

[b]Conclusion:[/b] All in all, this DLC was fun to play, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys the borderlands series, I do emphasis caution because the game has aged, but if that detail doesn't phase you, this DLC definitely deserves a play through.

Boring because you have to run A LOT between a long distances checkpoints doing the damn side quests. No cars, no shet, just walking and shooting out from running crowds.

9000,"Just like its base game, Spear of Destiny is a good expansion of Wolfenstein 3D, but I feel like the Steam port is not that great.

Again, we play as B.J Blazkowicz in one of his missions to ruin the nazis' plans. This time, the nazis stole the Spear of Destiny: the legendary spear that gives power to whom manages to use it. This time the plot seems very Indiana Jones-lookalike, but it's ok.

Nothing changed compared to Wolfenstein 3D, and once again, I find problematic the controls. Compared to ports found on the Internet, this one feels too clunky and bland. 

Just like the gameplay: graphically nothing changed from the predecessor.

And guess what? The sounds are the same from Wolfenstein 3D.

Now it's not avaiable on Steam, but I bought it for 1€ (sales) and it was too much for me. Basically it's a mild Wolfenstein 3D experience, so search on the Internet for a better way to play this.

Sorry old school gamers, but Spear of Destiny is not that great for me (at least the Steam version). If you find any port more fluid than this, it can be great, but avoid to play this version",False,1

9030,"Second and in my opinion better expansion of Quake. You have few weapon alterations, different from first expansion, which are even more deadly.(I am big fan of multiple rockets and cluster grenades.) The game brings more items and enemies as well. You fight more fantasy foes than before, like altered knights and death knights which were turned into statues of greek warriors and minotaurs, floating swords or dark wizards who reminds me of Mental from Serious Sam. New items are Anti-Grav Belt and Power Shield. First one will make you jump higher into longer distances and second will reduce taken damage. Two new episodes contains fantasy and ancient history based levels with unique bosses like Guardians, Hephaestus or Overlord. Individual levels are pretty hard to play. Not because of lots of enemies, but because of shaking grounds, slippery surfaces (which leads to lava or void or another kind of death) and mazy levels.(Curse of Osiris!) But its really worth it. And after all these hellish fighting you spawn into final cave to face the Dragon. I recommend it highly for all FPS fans.",True,44
9030,"I love the mission pack. Quake is amazing, however, as many have already experienced, Mission Pack 2 is impossible to finish without cheating or using strange tricks. In Tomb of the Overlord, it is impossible to go up the elevator with the red arrow buttons. You can press them, but it doesn't move the elevator. You either have to rocket jump up or use the Fly cheat. I want to beat the normal way. Please fix.",False,23
9030,"Dissolution of Eternity is the second and final Quake 1 mission pack. It's a very fitting end to the game's official content and dovetails nicely with the previous expansion pack, Scourge of Armagon. It was developed by Rogue entertainment who also developed Strife and American McGee's Alice.

Dissolution is much more fantasy based than Armagon. There's a distinctly mythological slant to the whole thing. You fight fantasy enemies like statues that come alive, these wraith like grim reaper creatures, magical swords that float and attack you, and the final boss is even a Dragon. It reminds me a lot of the original Quake's roots as a medieval fantasy game before the developers redesigned it as a first person shooter.

Indeed looking at Dissolution like that it really does make the game feel like it comes full circle with the original Quake. It has a few really good boss encounters that fill in the gaps of quality that were unfortunately lacking in the original. It is also legitimately challenging and several of the levels are very long and feel almost epic length.

The main negatives I would say about Dissolution of Eternity are the additional weapons they added weren't as impressive as Scourge of Armagon. You have things like a nailgun that shoots slightly more powerful nails, a rocket launcher that shoots three rockets at once, a lightning gun that just shoots a single projectile. If you play it back to back with Scourge you'll start to miss MJOLNIR.

But besides that. The levels are all good, the action is still fresh, and it has a final boss encounter that more than makes up for how easy Armagon was. It makes for a fitting end to the original Quake, and it only makes you want to play through the entire saga again to experience it a second time.",True,20
9030,"[h1][b]Quake Mission Pack 2: Dissolution Of Eternity		* 8/10[/b][/h1]

This second mission pack goes in an opposite direction compared to the first one.

The game will be very tough as you will have to sweat longer to get new weapons, and the maps will be full of enemies, making this a real challenge.
There are no new weapons but there are alternative ammos that give the player another fire option with different damage or effects, such as lava nails or multiple rockets.
Level art now is more focused with meso-american, Egyptian or greek art styles prooviding more visual innovation, and according to that there will also be various minor bosses, such as guardians, or mummies.

Considering the age of the game and the lack of 16:9 resolutions I would suggest to play it with any modern port available as it could provide some serious graphical update as well. I've played this with darkplaces and various texture packs.

[h1]+++PROs+++[/h1][list]
[*][b] INNOVATION.[/b] This expansion provides a good product enriched with visual innovation and artistically inspired maps, not to mention the simplicity of the effective alternative ammos for the classic weapons.
[*][b] TOUGH.[/b] This expansion will really test you as you'll have to sweat a lot before you get something more powerful than your standard shotgun, you'll have to take down a lot of creatures with that first and going on with the game it'll be worse as there will be crowds of enemies, and you will have to wait for further weapons, making each level a tough challenge
[/list]
[h1]---CONs---[/h1][list]
[*][b] OLD ENGINE.[/b] The engine is quite old nowadays and lacks 16:9 resolutions. If you want higher resolutions you have to check also the DPI box in the Exe properties. Alternatively you can load the game using one of the many modern ports available around. I've used Darkplaces.

9030,"QUAKE Mission Pack 2: Dissolution of Eternity

This is good expansion for Quake, better than the first. You get few weapon alterations, different from first expansion. The game brings more items and enemies. You fight altered knights and death knights. New items are anti gravity belt and power shield. Anti gravity belt will make you jump higher into longer distances. Power shield will reduce taken damage.

I can recommend this to all Quake players and everyone who likes old fps games. Quake series are probebly the best. Grade for this game 9/10",True,9
9030,"How's THAT for a metal title? The second expansion of the original Quake held nothing back in the naming, and similarly holds nothing back in the challenge. Whereas Scourge of Armagon felt at times like The Lost Levels to Quake's Super Mario Bros, Dissolution of Eternity sometimes seems like The Loster Levels. This isn't necessarily down to good design, either, so if you're here looking for more quality Quake, you might want to read on before pulling the trigger.

Whereas Quake had four episodes to choose from and Armagon had one long campaign, Dissolution has two themed episodes to frag through. The first, Hell's Fortress, is a series of sprawling castles, caves, and catacombs. The second, Corridors of Time, is an assortment of historically-themed touching on Egyptian tombs, Mayan sacrifices, and, uh, wizard towers. You might note that none of these lineups contain anything techy or eldritch, and that's an important thing to keep in mind. Dissolution's 14 levels are all roughly castle or tomb themed, skipping two of the major Quake aesthetics and leaving most of the grunts behind.

A strongly-themed pack isn't a bad thing as long as the levels are executed well, but for the most part I can't say they are. The first level of Hell's Fortress is a prime example of the pack's shortcomings. It's a castle you infiltrate through towers and tunnels, but all the architecture is flat, featureless, and relies too heavily on single textures. You're going to get very, very tired of olive brick and brown caves after just a few levels, owing in part to how much longer and larger they are than base Quake maps. The later parts of episode one and parts of episode two have more interesting designs but they feel like the exception, not the rule.

The gripes don't end at the architecture, either. Encounters throughout Dissolution tend to happen in cramped spaces like narrow corridors, rather than the platforms and arenas you'd expect from the prior Quake maps. Part of this is obviously owing to the heavy reliance on knight enemies, but once ogres and fiends start getting mixed in you'll find fights ending very quickly, often not in your favor. The new enemies only exacerbate this, with most of them having wide attack patterns and several exploding on death. And if that wasn't enough, most levels rely heavily on traps like collapsing floors and swinging axes to up the ante, but instant death in a lava pit only leads to frustration given the length of the levels.

At least the new weapons help blunt the painful combat. They're not really new weapons, but new ammo types for your existing weapons that generally do more damage. Nailguns get lava nails, launchers get cluster explosives, and the lightning gun can be switched to a BFG-style projectile. For some reason the ammo placement doesn't seem to take the new ammo types into account, so you'll be topped off on most ordnance even through pitched battles. There are some creative item additions like shields and gravity belts, but the levels are never really designed to take advantage of them, as if the item and level designers had no idea what the other was doing.

Overall, Dissolution of Eternity plays like a more immediately lethal form of Quake without much else to add. The levels are longer but not as expertly crafted in look, feel, or mechanics. Between the cramped combat and obnoxious traps you're more likely to run into bouts of frustration, and the new enemies, ammo, and items don't make much difference in the face of that. It's more Quake and more Quake is good, but if you're still jonesing after the base game and Scourge of Armagon, you might be better served with community maps.

-Armies/Units
The British are a good solid defensive faction. Most of their power comes from emplacements you build.
Pros- Command Trucks are used for HQs, meaning you can place them in any of your secured territories, boosting its resource output. Heavy defensive positions like Slit Trenches, MG Positions, AT gun emplacements and Mortar emplacements can be built for a small amount of resources and population. Infantry can be upgraded with many different weapons, increasing their efficency against other infantry, light vehicles or heavy tanks. Their doctrines offer Commando Support which allows you to land a glider with 6 Commandos, a glider with a light tank that is effective against halftracks, infantry and other light tanks, and a HQ glider which allows the production of AT commandos, Mortar Commandos and HMG commandos.
Cons- They are purely defensive (unless you use the Commando Doctrine) and do not have much offensive capabilty. Their infantry walks very slowly through enemy or uncaptured territory to gain more defensive against attacks (which is annoying at the start). Their tanks (aside from the Sherman Firefly) all have small guns but heavy armor that can't do shit against many medium to heavy tanks. 
-The Panzer Elite are a very mobile faction. Most of their amor is made up of halftracks (which can be pretty powerful) but they can get some good heavy tanks and tank destroyers. 
Pros- Great faction for quick and powerful attacks. Infantry halftracks let the garrisoned squad shoot out the top with any weapons they have (bazzokas, mgs or snipers). The Marder tank destroyer is extremely good with an ability to ""lock-down"" making it immoblie but a faster rate of fire that does more damage. Almost all of their infantry can repair stuff. 
Cons- As said before, their armor are halftracks. 
-Overall Score: 8.5/10

[h1]TL:DR? See Conclusion[/h1]

[h1]INTRODUCTION:[/h1]
Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts is a real-time strategy game developed by Relic Entertainment and published by THQ (RIP). This game serves as the first official expansion pack to the series which adds two new factions, new units, a German (Panzer Elite) and British campaigns along with new multiplayer maps.

The expansion pack 'Opposing Fronts' added 2 new campaigns for the new factions of Great Britain who's plot revolves around the British Royal Army's operation to retake and secure the city of Caen in northern France. On the other-hand, the new Axis campaign featured the Panzer Elite faction in their mission to foil an Allied Operation called 'Market Garden'.

[h1]PROS:[/h1]
+ Improved special effects
+ New Factions
+ German and British Campaigns
+ New Units are fun to play with
+ Standalone Expansion but...(See CON #3)
+ Allows players with the expansion to play with players without the expansions and vice versa

[h1]CONS:[/h1]
- Balance issues
- AI is somehow worse than the original
- Does not include the original armies unless you have the original game
- Campaign has some dull moments
- Inconsistent sound / voice levels for some of the units

[h1]CONCLUSION:[/h1]
GOOD EXPANSION but could have used a little more polish. Opposing Fronts is a great expansion that adds a lot of replayability to the original game by adding new factions; new units; new Campaign and a ton of improvements that increases the authentic feel and immersion of the game.

MUST BUY for RTS and World War 2 fans whether at full price or on sale. Although, I highly advice the [b]'Complete Pack'[/b] (which includes the original game and the 2 expansions) to have the full experience.

9340,"By far the best RTS. Relic have nailed the idea of making the whole genre more actiony. They did it with Warhammer but that stuck more to a particular audience and the slight cartoonish graphics put many off. Now in company of heroes it has polished graphics and a subject to suit a wider audience. WW2 although seems quite an over used subject for gaming, has never been as explored as this in an RTS form. The reason for giving it an 8 is because the new expansion was a marketing scheme all along.

Two new factions are introduced, a defensive British army and a mobile German one. However neither of them really brings anything new to the formula.

The campaigns are an utterly standard experience and although the cut-scenes and storyline have been heavily improved upon the gameplay is inferior to that of the original American campaign.

9450,"If I could give a Mixed review, I would. This is a ""Mixed"" standalone expansion for a great game. I've been pondering quite long on whether to mark it as a positive or a negative review - the former I feel might be misleading, whereas the latter might be cruel. It truly is a mixed experience, with both good and bad.

Provided it's on sale or you get it in a package with all the others, and you're already a fan of the game or the setting, I think it's worth it. If this is somehow your first foray into Warhammer and Dawn of War, please just get the base game or Dark Crusade instead.

The pros of Soulstorm are easily visible. Two new factions, both with a very cool aesthetic. It introduces new units, new mechanics, new maps, and a new campaign. All of this is good - I mean, come on, it's the Dark Eldar and the Sisters of Battle. Bar a couple exceptions like the Tyranids, it also means the game has pretty much everyone from the setting, and you can pit them all against each other.

Getting it for the skirmish mode alone might be worth it to you, though that depends.

The cons, however, are hard for me to pinpoint exactly. They are hard for me to see, but I can definitely feel them. Something is *off* when comparing it to the base game or the previous expansions. The new factions feel clunky and strange, and though maybe this is because I do not have enough hours in them, I still find myself picking others instead. They *look* fun, but they do not *feel* fun.

Cool to try once, and then go back to the other ones. This may be personal opinion, but I'm sure many feel the same way. There's something tedious or stiff about the ability meters, something lacking or perhaps somehow off-balanced about the unit roster. Something about the power bar that just feels... I don't know. Gimmicky? Somehow, even the Necrons with their out-there mechanics feel better to play, at least in my opinion.

Plus, there's a notable lack in polish and a drop in quality in certain aspects. Every so often, a crusty .jpeg will greet you instead of some better-looking icon, or a unit of one of the new factions will fail to play any animation if it's taken out in some unexpected way. Nothing truly game-breaking or upsetting, but again, continuing the *off* theme of the expansion.

The variety is welcome, but it's not really good variety. It's just... variety. Not terrible, but not excellent.

Then there's the campaign, which is pretty much just Dark Crusade except worse. More tedious. It asks you to hunt down every single crumb of enemy on the map, every single battle. Combined with the slow loading times even on modern PCs, I found myself often questioning the ratio of waiting (whether in the loading screen, or for my units to sweep the map for that one last plasma generator or whatever the enemy was hiding) to playing. *Tedious* is the word. Unfun might be another.

It feels like such a small change, but it transformed the fun experience of Dark Crusade into one that is hardly enjoyable, or even frustrating. Whereas Dark Crusade's campaign had me eagerly waiting to come back home and boot up my computer to play more, Soulstorm's campaign had me eagerly waiting the sweet release of the quit button.

Is it a bad game? No, not really. But I think it does deserve its place as the black sheep of the Dawn of War 1 variants. Of the base game and the other two expansions, it is the bottom ranking for me - and many others. On its own, it's... *fine.* Playing a bit of Skirmish is still fun. It's still Dawn of War.

Again, if you're just starting out, get the base game. If you're here for the cool overworld campaign content, get Dark Crusade. But on a discount or in a pack, Soulstorm is still worth a shot. If you just want to Skirmish as the Dark Eldar or Sisters of Battle, it's good enough for that. Even if it's a bit scruffy, at the end of the day it's more Warhammer. Plus, I hear the Unification mod is extremely good, though I've yet to try it.

[b][u]Positives[/u][/b]
[olist]
[*] Gish's physics
No longer will you randomly go inside-out or die when trying to jump or land lightly on a surface. Gish feels much better to control. This is the only thing this update is good for.
[*] Previous version
The update is so bad, that the ability to choose the previous version is the biggest positive. (Go to the game in the library, go to properties, go to betas, and choose 1.7)
[/olist]

[b][u]Neutral[/u][/b]
[olist]
[*] Widescreen support
The widescreen support is actually just the game zoomed in/cropped so you see less, it actually looked a bit better before it had widescreen support
[*] Updated visuals
The only thing that's different is a bit of light on Gish. Not really even noticeable.
[/olist]

[b][u]Negatives[/u][/b]
[olist]
[*] The new ""Lost Levels"" 
There is literally no new content in the update whatsoever. The Lost Levels aren't new at all and already existed in previous versions from years ago.
[*] No level editor
The level editor was one of the biggest reasons Gish was so fun to me. It had one of the most complex level editors for a 2d game ever, but was very user unfriendly. I was hoping the update would improve the level editor, not remove it entirely. I was also hoping for Steam workshop support for easy level/campaign sharing, but obviously updates mean we have to delete everything, not add anything!
[*] No custom levels
You can't load any community made levels. Some of the community campaigns were better than the official campaign. The previous version also included most community made levels in it already, the new update deletes all this.
[*] No difficulty selection
The game is now defaulted to the easiest difficulty, rendering the lives mechanic redundant and ruining the incentive to explore levels to find more lives.
[*] No small Gish mode
A side effect of the deletion of difficulties, now you can't pick small Gish mode :(
[*] Achievements are broken
Not a single achievement can be unlocked. And even if achievements DID work, some would be impossible because they're tied to a certain difficulty, which do not exist anymore.
[*] Terrible menus
Can't change resolution or change key bindings like you previously could.
[*] No telekinesis
The secret telekinesis block is still there, but you don't get any powers.
[*] Removed VS modes
Some of the Versus modes are removed.
[*] No level select
The only levels you can specifically select to play are the Lost levels. The old level select is gone.
[*] No save slots anymore
[*] An Egypt secret level is missing
[*] No blood
Killing enemies or injuring Gish no longer make particles come out. A very noticeable downgrade
[*] Missing many sound effects
Rop/chains breaking, collecting coins, etc.
[*] No level summary screen
No screen to tell you how many secrets you found and how much you collected, etc.
[*] Some missing animations
Some lava animation is missing, some water in a Lost level is missing animation, etc.

In conclusion, the Steam version of Gish is utter garbage and no one should even consider buying it. It completely ruins one of my all-time favourite games. I fail to understand why any developer would update their 15 year old game by removing a ton of features and barely changing anything else, and adding literally NOTHING to compensate. An utter embarrassingly shameful disgrace.",False,389

9500,"I am writing this review primarily for those who have also reviewed it and have claimed that the controls are somehow bad.

The simple fact is that if you are finding the controls difficult, you are trying to play the game wrong. Trying to play this game like a normal platformer, staying on the ground, trying to time your jumps, and ignoring many of Gish's abilties will result in abysmal failure. Instead, your main focus needs to be on your momentum. Knowing the levels is key, so that you can plan out a route before hand which is fluid and smooth. Even a tiny change in your path can drastically change how you move across the terrain and can be the difference between leaping across a huge gap or flopping and losing all your speed. Jumping is everything. Setting yourself up properly for a good jump, even if that requires you to go out of your way or backtrack, can often lead to significantly improved times due to the extra speed you will carry out of it.

That being said, this isn't easy. Even beyond the ~15 hours I have clocked on Steam I had played the demo extensively many years ago. One of the great things you can do when you do get good at it is speedrunning it for fun, as I stated before the gameplay revolves around keeping your speed, and there are also a number of shortcuts, alternate routes, or even somewhat abusable physics bugs which you can use to your advantage.

As for other things, the Edmund McMillen style is nice, though the graphics and interface are clearly dated. There are a number of minor bugs in the physics which can be frustrating until you learn to work around them. Overall I think the uniquness of the gameplay outweighs the flaws.

I'll end with a couple tips for those who want to become better:
-tapping sticky while climbing allows you to climb much faster, it also helps while moving across the ground
-being at high speed and then pressing sticky will cause you to compress down, allowing you to get a good jump in
-holding slippery+heavy while in the tiny tubes will make you go faster through them, and sometimes you can launch out of the exit
-slippery+heavy is optimal for pushing blocks around without getting caught up on them
-while climbing, you can swing around 90 degree corners by tap-releasing sticky and using the arrow keys to shift your weight",True,38

[h2]tl;dr[/h2]
Developers put out a 15 year release anniversary and updated the game to be a 100% inferior experience. We're not just talking minor issues, tons of content is outright gone and some is left in half-baked/not functional.

You *can* opt-in to a beta branch that has an older version of the game which is perfectly functional. But what a way to treat you game. They really dropped the ball.

[h1]Version170 Branch Game Review:[/h1]
As for the game itself, it is alright. But it does not hold up very well nowadays. If I had to draw a comparison, take something like Surgeon Simulator and combine it with a platformer game. 

Gish is a physics based platformer. If you are familiar with platformers, this one will take you for an interesting loop. You need to get used to Gish's unique mechanics to platforming which can be frustrating, though they definitely work and can be mastered with enough effort. 

The main drawback is how it very much feels like a lot of browser games from 15 years ago. Where some levels are not *hard* but frustrating and too long. Having you do the same frustrating levels multiple times. It also has no level select and automatically boots you to the next level if you fail a bonus stage, requiring you to start all the way from the start of the game if you want to play it again.

Art is alright, I enjoyed how they made ""light reflections"" on Gish's skin.
The music is awful.

Overall, interesting ideas executed in a sub-par manner.",False,12

Due to that poor tech decision, I failed over & over trying to compensate for the control desync issues in the apartment panic sequence where whatshisname is being pushed to leap off his balcony.

Tech issues aside, it would have been best to leave it at that, but I wanted to see just how off the rails the story supposedly went and...Yeah, the story loses all focus the longer it goes and while it's almost so bad it's funny, it's probably funniest if you're not having to muddle through the bland gameplay. Years later, Quantic Dream & David Cage would reel themselves in a little with Heavy Rain, which is somewhat better (at least until you replay it for different narrative paths), but ultimately all their games are better to watch someone else play than to play yourself.

Indigo Prophecy was the beginning of Quantic Dream's bland narrative game formula that, while adjusted over the years, still resembles this old game. Largely uninteresting narrative branches, clunky dialogue, flashes of mild to overt sexism/racism, bland QTEs, & clumsy minutiae ridden interactions.

If there's any highlight to this game, it's the opening and the early intrigue, but because it's Quantic Dream, it fails to follow through and loses the plot at the most critical moments.",False,0

Then you realise like 50% of the game is just more of that. 

I respect Quantic Dream for their effort towards making a more cinematic adventure game. Sometimes, it succeeds. You can feel the spark. For just a minute at a time, you will care about how your performance affects the other characters. You will get drawn into some moody location and feel curious and tense and immersed.  The game and the film come together to make something new.

Unfortunately, both the game and the film are awful, so these moments are rare.

I won't go too much into either (like how on the game side there are constant annoying QTE and dialogue options are indecipherably vague, or how on the story side the dialogue is stilted and the plot goes into totally off-the-rails nonsense in the last third), but there is one particular thing that offended me, that made me want to write a review, which is how badly used the characters of Carla and Tyler are by the end. 

The further the game delves into the supernatural, the less relevant two police officer characters are going to become. And it is clear the writers had totally no idea how to handle this: instead of coming up with some new way that Carla and Tyler can contribute to the plot, they basically get dropped entirely. 

Tyler literally vanishes suddenly from the story, whereas Carla just gets shoved disrespectfully into the role of Lucas's love-interest with no build-up, and does nothing further of note. I'm not sure which is worse, especially considering Lucas is literally a walking corpse at that point.

I can't exaggerate just what a massive fail this is for the story. We've spent just as much time getting to know these two as we have with Lucas, and they are both more interesting than Lucas! When the game decides ""Actually, these two aren't relevant"", it's not only a waste of two good characters — and of all the considerable mocap and voice acting and money that went into creating them — it's a waste of your time.",False,0
9760,"+ Good graphics.
+ Challenging AI.
+ No redundant units.
+ Does not require the original Direct Action to play.

- Campaign not as good as Direct Action.
- Online multiplayer requires 3rd-party software (Hamachi or GameRanger)
- AI does not support all game modes.

[b]The Good[/b]
We'll start with the graphics: very good considering this game came out in 2006. The stock maps just as detailed as Direct Action, but with far more variety - Aside from the usual desert and urban maps, you can now play on more forest and jungle theatres.

Infantry play a prominent role right up until the late game. Act of War focuses less on tank rushing and requires the player to think a bit more. Well placed infantry, for example, can ambush a tank convoy from trees/tall grass and gain a x2 damage bonus. Likewise, artillery could be used to clear out forests and potential ambush zones. It's nice to play an RTS where infantry are more than just cannon fodder.

There are some very interesting game mechanics here too. While oil is your main source of income, it is still a finite resource and will run dry eventually. You can take and hold banks to acquire funds, or you can even take wounded enemies as hostages for ransom.

The expansion also adds naval warfare, which actually works rather well once you get the knack for it. Each faction has it's own unique variety of ships with different play styles.

Another interesting mechanic introduced to High Treason is the addition of mercenary units. These are expensive, but very effective specialist units that excel in what they do. For example, you can hire a specialist team of medics to provide a heal radius around wounded infantry - or call in the Rawhide artillery team and level an enemy base with rockets from afar.

[b]The Bad[/b]
The AI does not work in naval warfare, which means you're up against humans whether you like it or not. Only a minor complaint, but sometimes it's nice to practice against the AI and hone your skills.

The campaign is brutally hard compared to Direct Action. Some veteran players might be okay with the tougher AI, but I personally struggled. Also the lack of live-action cut-scenes was also a disappointment.

[b]The Ugly[/b]
Compatibility issues lie with Windows Vista, Win7 and Win8. There is a Win7 compatibility patch on ModDB which works perfectly - you can get it [url=www.moddb.com/games/act-of-war-direct-action/downloads/proper-windows-7-fix-for-act-of-war]here[/url]

The factions are really awesome and diverse, for example, Task force talon has simple base building and units that are masters at adapting to any situation, units can be further upgraded for unleashing hell on who ever you place the attack order on, while the US army (or murica) have to rely on power sources for their buildings and their units mainly excell in only a few fields having different types of units to deal with what ever the threat may be, infantry, armored or air.

9760,"[h1]Review for [i][u]Act of War: Direct Action[/u][/i][/h1]
Act of War: Direct Action has got to be the absolute best Real Time Strategy (RTS) game I've ever played in my entire life - and I'm a HUGE fan of Command and Conquer. The entire franchise.

Act of War: Direct Action had elements I never saw in Command and Conquer. For example, entering buildings was new but you had to first destroy the building or clear the enemy out before re-capturing it. A lot of times once the enemy had it, you couldn't take it from them. Command and Conquer: Red Alert 2 is a good example. In Act of War: Direct Action, if an enemy has a building and you want it, you must send in your infantry to fight for it. Your infantry will garrison the building and fight indoors to wrest control over it. Usually whomever has the most units or highest ranking units wins and the survivors are placed outside to be captured or left for dead.

I forgot to mention one of the best features of the game! You can capture wounded enemy infantry or non-combatants like vehicle crews or pilots. On the map, the resource is oil. You will eventually run out of it and once you do, well, you're sort of stuck. You'll get no more money. At all. Unless you have a hospital handy and enough to train some infantry. Wound some enemies, destroy some vehicles, and capture the infantry. Each enemy you capture gives you immediate money plus $50 every ~30 seconds. Each hospital can hold 10 prisoners so that's $500 every ~30 seconds. You can have an unlimited amount of hospitals to gain more and more money.

Units also gain veterancy based on kills and captures. When they attain new veterancy, their health bar increases and they get a small surge of healing/repairing for a few seconds. They also become more deadly.

Not to mention that each faction of the 3 available is unique in its own way. I usually pick favourites in RTS games but not this one. I can't. I absolutely love all 3 factions for different playstyles.

Building in this game was interesting too. The buildings were awesome and the animations for each structure fit amazingly. Airdropping a vehicle? You can watch it do so at no additional cost to wait time - the animation IS part of the wait time. Works for all types of structures.

You could call in airstrikes which I thought was amazing, but could make a game very difficult. There were lots of upgrades, vehicles, and infantry. The game was amazing.

What made it the best for me was how everything reacted to each other. In other games like Command and Conquer, infantry inside of a building could make short work of a tank. In Act of War: Direct Action, a tank takes less damage from small arms fire and can punch holes in structures. If hit in the right spot, can wipe out a small group of garrisoned infantry. Most of the time the building catches fire and it varies in size and can sometimes envelope the entire screen, making it hard to see what's going on. What else? Infantry can be placed on top of buildings - on the roofs. It doesn't really provide any extra cover or other bonuses but it's awesome. Sometimes I like to airdrop mortars on top of structures - like banks - to rain hell on the enemy and protect them from enemy tanks.

I can easily say I put over 1,000 hours into this game during the years I owned it. Of course, I owned it on disc. I still do, actually. I still find it to be the absolute best RTS game out there, right next to Company of Heroes 2 presently for realism. 

[h1]Review for [i][u]Act of War: High Treason[/u][/i][/h1]
Pretty much just an expansion of all the above but with added features.

-New campaign which doesn't really add up to the enjoyability of the Direct Action campaign
-New units which are awesome
-Mercenaries
-Ship combat (only for multiplayer unless mods?)
-New maps
-Changed gameplay elements (some are annoying)
-Lots of Engagement customization for playing skirmish against AI.

Otherwise, it's the exact same as above. I only recently bought High Treason a couple years ago but either way, it pretty much gives me Direct Action with more features so I'll play this one. :)

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Act of War: Direct Action and Act of War: High Treason are two of the best RTS games out there. Definitely pick them up. Both of them. Play them. Enjoy them. They are classics and you will probably never find anything like this again in your life.

Very cheap too for such an awesome game! :D

P.S.
If you want an awesome campaign, play Direct Action. High Treason's is meh. :) Both games are $6.58CAD, so roughly $5USD? Worth it. :)",True,21
9760,"Act of War: High Treason is a strategy game develped by Eugen Systems. High Treason is an expansion pack to Act of War: Direct Action. The game is set three years following the events of the first game. To avoid spoilers, the whole gist of the first game is that a mega-rich fringe organisation invades America and attempts to take over the world. This game expands on the enemy faction The Consortium from the first game. However, this game involves the U.S. Army and treason from some top ranking major generals. I will note that I will compare everything to the first game as it is a sequel and thus a benchmark.

To begin, this game is great. The campaign so far has greater mission variety including stealth missions, which was a major hit, is more difficult, and is more engaging and intense compared to the first game. The story has had twists and turns including the U.S. Army, as noted above, and the reinvolvement of the Consortium. These twists make the game more exciting and fun for the player. And as said for the first game, the story becomes richer and more exciting as it progresses.

I will now summarise the rest in smaller points before pointing out the negatives of the game. The gameplay is fairly similar to the first. It has base-building and a typical birds eye view RTS game. So in other words, its a good combination.  The negatives with gameplay is the healing and repairing units have cooldowns on when to heal/repair your units. This makes the game more difficult, which can be a nuisence during the course of a mission. This means that repairing and healing units are sort of useless as the enemy will keep attacking and you will have cooldowns to repair/heal your units before an attack.

The UI, like the last game, is clean, slick and simple. I like it as everything is easy to access and there is not a clutter of options on the main screen when playing the game. There is still no steam overlay, but there is borderless windows so you do not have to quit the game to do other things on the computer such as using the internet. The game has 1920x1080 resolution, a major stepup from the previous game.

Now onto the negatives that will explain my negative review of the game. There are enormous amounts of bugs and technical issues that plague this game. The game crashes very frequently, resulting in frustration and an unplayable experience due to me having to constantly restart the game. To add insult to injury, there are very long loading times of missions and save games, meaning you are literally stuck on the loading screen more than the actual mission. It is quite strange as I had played five hours without issue and then it hits the Caribbean missions and these issues arise, effectively halting my playthrough of the campaign. I am thinking if it is this specific section of campaign that negatively affects the game. Regardless, these issues mean I cannot continue the campaign, resulting in a waste of time. Also, there are several other bugs including sound issues, which one time the sound engine crashed, and mission completion freezes.

Overall, I was really liking this game and enjoying the campaign. However, the issues that plagued the game have significantly impacted the game. Therefore, I have to not recommend this game from my personal experience on it. I will attempt to continue the game in the future and hopefully it will be stable. Following that, I will update this review. However, at this point in time, I cannot. The game is strong in most aspects though, so its unfortunate there are glitches. 3/10.

EDIT x1: I will note also that whilst I personally do not recommend the game due to the techncial issues, it is up to you to purchase the game for $2.99. Keep in mind my negatives on the game as if they are the same for yourself you can refund the game. As I did mention, the game's story is great and intense, so if you do buy it, hopefully there are no technical issues.

9760,"The sequal to Act of War Direct Action, I bought the DVD version back in 2006. so even Steam registered me only played less than an hour, I believe I can still write a fair review. 

first of all, you do not need to have AoW: DA installed to play. however 
 
Act of War: High Treason follows the TFT commander Jason Richter to discover and prevent a political scheme. Fight against the old enemy of Consortium and on few instances, the US military.

This sequal carries on the innovative system from AoW DA, where wounded infantry and downed pilot become part of the economy syetm in the game. It comes with new units and new campaign. the new units adds several tactical options for each factions. making it more interesting to play. However the missions are not as well designed as those in Direct Action: some comes with odd restriction and conditions, making it just too difficult to beat. New units includes Naval units, but only available in certian mission and some multiplayer maps.

AoW: HT adds Mercenary system, where carefully deployed Mercenaries can turn the tide of the battle. Be warned, it cost a lot to deploy mercenaries so use it wisely. 

Gone are the good Live action cutscene, replaced with CG. I do not believe this was voiced by original actor either. the charactor in this is more playful and the charactors in Direct Action are more collected, focused and let's say, ""no nonsense"". 

One improvement over Direct Action is: HT supports widescreen, 16:9 resolution. Keep in mind, this is after all a 2005/2006 game so don't expect to have top notch graphics from modern game engine. However it is still a fun game to play.

When it first launched on Steam, like Direct action, it suffered from memory addressing issue, but I believe it is now fixed. as I am able to play it with windows 8.1, i7 processor and 12GB of ram without any modification.",True,17
9760,"I liked the game very much back in the day it was released so I bought 2 copies on Steam since the game seems to have LAN multiplayer to play with my friend. We used Hamachi and wanted to play... but apparently LAN dosent work in this game as we didnt see each other in LAN game list. Suffice to say I wasted money on this and I cannot recommend it, seeing how they managed to broke such a simple thing as LAN functionality in a game whose normal boxed version has normal working LAN MP

SMALL UPDATE: so after many trials I finaly managed to host game where me and my friend see each other. And just when we thought SUCCESS!  it turns out every time you launch the game the guest player get disconnected during loading. Every time, after small research I found that his is a common occuring... so the game is still unplayable",False,15
9760,"Once you deal with the whole exceeds 2gbs of ram ordeal, its one of the best rts' i've played. It runs very smoothly and each faction is very unique yet very simple to use.

9850,"Lots of potential, but ultimately disappointing. The third entry in a realistic RTS series, it's absolutely filled with inaccuracies - supposed to take place in 1948, it includes tech ranging from 1940 to 1970 thrown together in truly haphazard fashion. Sometimes bizarrely accurate and little-known post-War inclusions are made, but much of the game is a mashup of ""rule of cool"" Vietnam era equipment that renders the unique 1948 date rather meaningless.

It dismantled the fantastic headquarters system of the previous Codename Panzers games in order to introduce a Starcraft-like resource control system on the maps, which makes it seem like a cheap copy of every other RTS game on the market instead of the more unique games that its predecessors had been. Speaking of cheap, the game was obviously made on a shoestring budget, as there's no audio for in-mission dialogue (a step backwards for the series,) little music, and what voice acting they do use is absurdly bad.

Then there's the story, which is so ridiculous that it becomes more painful to watch the longer you play. John Dillinger is *for real* a main character, having faked his death to defect to the USSR, and he flips wildly between his Chicago Gangster and Soviet Comrade personalities. The ending of the plot doesn't make any sense, mostly because it's hastily wrapped up in a final cutscene that plays more like a quick-cut montage. It's all so rushed that it feels more like an insult than a reward.",False,22

9850,"Previous games : Codename panzers phase 1 and 2.
Similar game : Road to Berlin
I played all  years ago and enjoyed it.
The reason why i set my teeth on the lastest release, Cold War.

Game style :
* fun RTS
* rock paper scissor mechanism
* no base building
* fog of war
* in essence only infantry and amory (tanks, APC) so no air or naval battles
* healing (infantery) and repairing units (APC)
* no indepth tactics needed or reading a thick manual
* limited units due to fixed unit cap
* capture hot spots (Points of Interest) to gain access to a helicopter pad, armor factory, healing station, radar station and so on.

Difficulty : played on 'hard' level which is recommended to have enough challenge to
beat the game. If you played RTS before, 'easy' is too easy.
Most difficult battle is not suprisingly the last mission.

Story line (6/10) :
You will tackle 18 missions which are linked with each other.
Some have an intro and/or outro cutscene, some don't.
Cutscenes can not match with those of the C&C serie (for example).
Looks a bit amateuristic which has it's charm though.
Western world is pushing back the commies (USSR and China) and kicking them out
of Europe. Sorry, for spoiling the plot.
You will play both sides in the single player campagain.

Mission objectives :
Each map comes of course with several mission objectives.
The primary objective is to finish the mission.
The secondary objectives are optional but can you give an asset during the battle.
There are secret objectives which you can discover, for this you need to examine the entire
map (find an empty Russian tank which you can use, using a tunnel, destroy a boat).
Objectives (except the secret ones) are displayed on the left side of the screen sometimes with additional commments of your commanders. It's not the best way to do so as you can oversee it.
I paused the game and verified the message log from time to time

Medals :
For completion of a mission you will get a bronze, silver or gold medal award.
Based on which credits is not explained in the manual.
Even after finishing the game, i do not have a clue on what it is based upon.
Is it time related + doing all side and secret missions + not losing any unit ?
Not really, something else, who will tell......

Graphics (8/10) :
Even today, it is still standing, detailed units, nice explosions, collapsing buildings.
Looks fine to me and not outdated.

AI (7/10) :
Selecting a bunch of units and ordering them to move to another area can sometimes
be complicated. Armor units are turning from left to right and back again before
they move. Can happen that the units are blocking each other and do not move.
Enemy is not too cunning therefore as said before, choose the hard level.
Most events and attacks are scripted.

Sound (6/10) : the same fanfare (trumpets - horns) sound over and over again.
Units produces the standard text lines like yes sir.
Explosions, gun fire and other environment noises are okay.

Bugs : Not encountered

To play or not to play :
Pfff, Cold War is not a must play nor it is boring.
I found the first two games innovative during their release.
Cold War is more of the same. If you have time and game is on sale, buy it.

The combat itself is hard to immerge in, because your troops are constantly outnumbered but still fight off hordes of enemy troops like it's nothing. The tutorial teaches you how to order a new tank once you've captured a helipad, but never zoom in on the barracks or how to get more infantry.

9870,"This game is masterfully good. I bought it several years ago and was blown away with how good it is. I'd like to cover a few key points that really make this game stand out from the rest.

-Original cast wrote the plot and voiced their characters! (Bill Murray sounds a little annoyed at returning.) The game is genuinely funny, intelligent, and spooky.
-Easily one of the most cinematic games ever created. The story intelligently bridges the first and second movies, as well as expands the Ghostbusters mythos and universe in intelligent directions.
-Revisit popular locations from the movies, without feeling like it's a gimmick! You have a reason for being there and doing what you're doing.
-There is almost no UI! Almost every function (health, overheating, ""ammo"", etc) is shown visibly on the character, via the Proton Pack, which actually manages to be easy-to-read and organic at the same time.
-Tobin's Spirit Guide is available for all the ghouls, ghosts, phantasms, class 5 full-formed repeaters, and spirit objects in the game, replete with their own back stories, lore, and rules. It allows enemies to be diverse and interesting, and fulfilling for lore hounds like myself.
-The game is fast-paced and fun, and switches the rules up often enough as to never feel stale.

The only cons I can think of for this game are that it's a bit linear, the upgrade system can be a bit of an annoyance from time to time, and the ""teammate revive"" mechanic can be a bit annoying, since the boys like to go down often on the tougher enemies. But none of these things deterred the experience for me and, at $10, this game is a STEAL! You HAVE to buy it. It's so worth it.",True,291
9870,"This is the closest that we'll ever get to a Ghostbusters 3. It's a great little game with the original actors from the movie lending their voices.

1. Bill Murray

3. I've always wanted to be a ghostbuster
4. (see number one)

9870,"Lately there's been a lot of disappointment expressed over this new Ghostbusters reboot movie, and a lot of people once again wishing for a true Ghostbusters 3. The great tragedy is how many of them will never know that it already existed 6 years ago in the form of this game, and was even called ""essentially the third movie"" by Dan Akroyd. The main 4 cast members all return to voice their characters (Rick Moranis is absent, tragically), and even a decent amount of side characters come back to reprise their roles. 

The premise of the game is pretty simple. Instead of playing as one of the Ghostbusters themselves, you play as a new recruit, who is about as self-insertion fodder as you can get. Aside from being totally mute, he isn't even given a name, with the main cast just referring to him by various different names like 'cadet' and 'new guy' because they ""don't like getting too attached to the recruits"". This means that there's no time wasted introducing a new character, and instead you just get to feel like you're on a ghostbusting tour with the fan favorites. One of my favorite aspects is how well the proton stream and new wearpons are brought into the game; you get other attachments that serve as other weapons throughout the game, but the proton beam is used to capture ghosts, done by damaging the ghosts enough to weaken them and then grappling them and slamming them into walls and other objects until they're dazed enough to be captured in a ghost trap. The proton beam leaves scorched spots wherever it contacts with a surface and almost everything in the game's areas are destructible, so every encounter with ghosts inevitably results in a once pristine location being reduced to a scorched disaster, making you feel just like the comical menace to bar mitzvahs, libraries, and hotels that the Ghostbusters are.

Unfortunately, the PC port of the game isn't that great. It was poorly optimized at launch, and while modern day computers should handle it fine, if your computer is a bit dated you might want to wait for an upgrade (though even on my modern PC I still dropped from an average of 120 FPS to around 8 to 11 during the final boss fight). Though no matter what your specs are, there's no dodging the mouse acceleration, which still haunts the game so badly that even the Ghostbusters wouldn't pick up if you called them to deal with it. Ghostbusters has probably the worst mouse controls I've seen in a game (barring games that just don't have them, like Dark Souls), and while it is playable enough that I've completed the game twice, it's not what I'd call acceptable, and if you're comfortable playing with a gamepad I would recommend using that instead. 

But ultimately, while the port isn't that great, and the game does decline in quality gameplay-wise for the last hour or so, I'd still recommend the game to anyone who's a fan of Ghostbusters. It's only $10, and while the story might feel a bit too much of the same, it's still as close to a Ghostbusters 3 as I feel we're ever going to get.",True,109

Pro's:
-------------------------------------
+ Character customisation allows a wide variety of costumes, materials and colours.

+ Tutorial sufficiently covers important aspects of the game without going overboard.

+ No apparent exp loss from dying.

+ Sizable, active community.

+ Missions have loads of variety.

+ Scenes are voiceacted.


Con's:
-------------------------------------
- Most classes locked behind paywall.

- Melee class feels severely imbalanced in combat.

- Flying is only marginally faster than walking.

- Community seems to ignore you entirely.

- Missions that require groups are generally impossible to beat because noone at low lvls group up.

- Cheap voiceactors, bad dialogue.


Overall:
-------------------------------------
As a double sword class, I was unable to get past lvl 11 and that's where my review data stops. The constant dying and the group missions I was forced to do solo make the game an incredible chore. While I feel the tutorial explains everything adequately, there's no helping the fact that Perfect World has screwed up player survivability.

Can I recommend this game based on the hope that PW fixes this, or that you can simply join a group for lvling? Not in the slightest. Perfect World is well known for being stubborn even in death (see Perfect World International), and the community itself would seemingly prefer to sit in the main city and talk nonsense than organise groups/raids.

Despite appearences, Champions Online has very little to offer the player. There's a million pricetags of premium content, loot is mostly spammed with costume lockboxes and missions give pitiful rewards for the effort it takes to complete them.

9900,"TL;DR; If you are a new player that doesn't want to open their wallet I would skip this one. 

Ok. This is a grindy, PvE pay-to-win game with horrible ground combat, decent space combat and the Star Trek license. I am saying this as someone who has played this game since launch, is a Lifetime Subscriber, been through multiple publisher swaps, seen everything from the ground rework to the lootboxes. No I don't fault the devs. I don't hate on them. They got screwed from the get go with a short development time and CBS breathing down their necks. If you're thinking about getting this due to there being four Star Trek shows out and having an interest in more Trekkin' I'd skip it. Bridge Commander with mods or Starfleet Command are better. You can find a little fun here but at the end of the day there's better choices out there. 

While I'm neutral with the devs I won't excuse some of the issues of this game that are in the core of this spaghetti filled mess. If this game didn't have the Star Trek IP it would have died out a long time ago. There are bugs still in the game from when I started playing, odd quirks and old game design choices that don't really jive with players now. Add on an egregious cash shop, ship bundles that are massively overpriced (seriously some are priced to be worth a few AAA games ) and the power creep over a decade of wanting players to open up their wallets it just ends up being bad feeling. 

I've done the grinding, the mass spamming of random dungeon queues for reputation marks, the gear grind to get to game breaking levels of damage (literally where a few dungeons will not end if I go all out) and now this is just a little toy for some space Barbie. I enjoy logging in to look at my ship or just fly around Sol for a bit then leave. Some of the arcs (think story chapters) are ok, some are great (Victory is Life) and some are just... No. This game needs a massive shot in the arm of money and a massive overhaul down to the core/engine like Final Fantasy 14 had. Until then it's just a mediocre space game that any new player should really skip. Happy gaming.",False,46
9900,"So, if you want instant gratification, Pay2Win, play to be the best, this game is not for you. It's a casual game that will take some time to get good gear. People complain that there isn't much in the way of negotiating and exploration... Yes, its true, but there was not a ton of that in any of the shows or movies. Enterprise season 3 was all fights and plotting against the crew all the time. TOS was almost all action all the time. So, expecting the game to be different is odd.

The thing that keeps me here is, I can spent 20 minutes and feel like I accomplished something. Most games these days, you need at least a hour or two to do much of anything. You can get to max level in a few weeks, or a long weekend, if you really want to. The grind is for the must part gone. What's left, is just enough to make you feeling of accomplishment. The game used to be a huge grind, and was not much content one upon a time. Klingon side was a joke for content, it was so desolate. Now there is a lot of cool stuff to do, and new stuff coming out all the time.

If you start working up a Federation character, this pack gives you a better T1 ship, mostly because it has an extra bridge officer slot than the Miranda.  The T1 ship also comes equipped with the Resonance Cascade Modulator console.  The Resonance Cascade Modulator (which allows the use of Team Fortress) is one very useful console.  It reduces the damage to your entire team's shields by 20% and prevents normal damage from bleeding through these shields for 12 seconds after activation.  It says 'normal' damage for a reason; exotic damage, such as those from most science abilities, can still pass through.  This console is even more useful because it comes on the T1 ship and not the T5.  This means that your Romulan characters that are Federation allied can use it as well.  The bridge officers in this pack are ok, but I replaced them with better after progressing through the game.  The equipment is only good for the beginning of the game, but I guess that is why its called a ""Starter"" pack.  However, the T5 ship alone is well worth the price of this entire pack, especially if you get it on sale like I did.  The T5 ship is great for a ship of that quality.  It is as good as fleet ships, as it already starts with the extra console slot.  With a 1 shield modifier, it has more shields than most other escorts.  Combined with its base hull of 34,500 - also high for an escort - it can take more than a few punches, especially if you use the Team Fortress ability properly.  It is still good after the release of T6 ships because its T5U upgrade adds another tactical console slot, allowing for a further boost to damage.  To top off the cake that is this bundle, there is the exclusive ""Steam Powered"" title.  I have had this pack since it released and have only seen a few other people with the title, or the ship for that matter.  This pack is NOT available through the in game store, so it is overlooked by most people.

I updated this review because it was pointed out that I originally had the shield modifier wrong.  I am sorry for any confusion that may have caused.",True,15

9908,"I really liked this game, I wanted to play a sci-fi space shooter and thats what STO does so well.  At the time it was on sale so I took the lifetime package.  Yep I am in this game for the life of it, but I would not recommend this game for anyone else.  Sorry, because this game has potential just needs a better developer. 

Pros:
Graphics in space and space combat are nice, there are better but they do a decent job
Game is space oriented not too much running around on planets.
Fairly reasonable game events the game has a large population even with all its problems.

Cons:
Very much pay2win, and most my friends that play usually told me that they went to other sites to buy items or EC to purchase items in game.
Dropbox galore: Almost all the good stuff is from a drop box or you have to buy it.  They do have some events that give away some items like ships etc. but the grind is intense. 
Serious grinding takes place for items and end game, yeah you can do foundry missions, but that just another form of grind and its pretty lame to just sit there and shoot ships so you can loot make EC then get some items.
Did I say this game is a grind??
PVP: unless your in a pvp guild and they kit you up forget it, you pugs and non pvp guilds wont even last a few seconds in pvp its so slighted towards these pvp guilds its crazy.  Its not even fun for just the avg joe to go in and play a quick match.
Story lines for new updates and download content is light in story and can be done in anywhere from a few hours to a couple of days.  They expect you to pay 160 for reskinned ships, new clothes/uniform designs, and a few hours of content.  Which really anyone could have developed in a foundry mission.  The service is getting worse as this game goes on.  

Soooo now to the real reason I cannot recommend this game to anyone.  The game runs like crap.  I have noticed a steady decline in this games function throughout the year I been sub'd but now it stutters so much I cannot even log on.  My toons are always getting dropped and when I go to sign on again, I am continually dropped from the login servers.  So, yep I payed a lifetime membership to play login all day.  When you post or talk about the crappy server status we are blamed. Its obviously our IP and Internet service, but really I could see that if it was just a few of us but its not its everyone.  They say they cannot control this problem its something called a Cognet?  Well, every other game I play has issues, crap even defiance had a weekend of stuttering, however they fix it or find a work around.  I have an Asus Rog and really do not have any problems playing any game.  Just this one.  

Bottom line, do not pay money for this game, play it and enjoy it if your just free subing ... if you can get online and play it.   My only saving grace to this game is that I am a lifetime member and the hope is there will be only a few people on the servers as this game matures and I can log in and do what I like.

9908,"Star Trek Online has changed in various major ways since this Starter Pack was originally released, but the pack itself remained unchanged, both in terms of its content, and the price.

So here's the deal - there's NOTHING here that will impact your starting gameplay experience in any major way. All the listed Mk II items and Bridge Officers are not that great, even for early levels, and are not really that useful. You'll find better gear just by leveling and you'll dump these quickly.

Aside from that, the Starter Pack contains:
[list]
[*]A ""Steam Powered"" title, that appears over your character if you set it up. Useless ""decoration"".
[*]Resonance Cascade Modulator - a unique console to use on any ship, which may be fun for a while when leveling, but ends up being useless at the endgame.
[*]Tier 1 Steamrunner Class ship - basically a different starting ship than the default one. You'll fly it for an hour or two before moving on to much better stuff.
[*]Tier 5 Steamrunner Class ship - a quite good tactical ship for endgame content. The thing is, with the level cap increase some time ago Cryptic introduced Tier 6 ships, which are objectively better. You will be able to upgrade the Tier 5 Steamrunner to a better variant if you'll buy a Ship Upgrade Token, but it still won't be AS good as any proper Tier 6. More on that later.
[*]Admirality Ship Cards for both the ships, to use in the Admirality System. Very useful regardless of how many ship cards you have.
[/list]

All the items above are unique to the Steam Starter Pack and cannot be obtained in any other way. Also, the pack is purely for Federation players - there is nothing for Klingons or Romulans.

It may seem weird to pay for content that's kind of outdated, but truth be told, you can still get a lot out of it. The Tier 5 ship may not be as good, or as interesting as many of the new Tier 6 ships, but it's still really effective and competitive in all types of content. I'm still flying the Steamrunner on my main character, despite having access to nearly any other ship in the game that may be considered ""better"". It all comes to looks and preferences, as Star Trek Online is in a state where you can be competitive in nearly any ship, as long as you know what you're doing.

In short, I'd say the pack is worth getting at a discount if you like the Steamrunner's design. Plus you'll get two Admirality Ship Cards which surely will come useful. Other than that though it's hard to recommend the pack to an average player, as there are many other more interesting offers in the game.",True,4

9930,"As my car hurtles over the tallest cliff in Hawaii, I take one last look in the rear-view mirror. How did it come to this? For the longest time I was just another loser, content with a mundane life and those brief moments of escapism. Somehow over the course of nearly 30 hours in Test Drive Unlimited 2, I became a monster. 

Sometimes when people play videogames, it's to get away, like a virtual vacation. But there are those times, where I don't want to be a plumber, a rodent with an attitude, a criminal, or Laura Bailey. I just want to drive around in expensive automobiles. In the real world I own two cars, one of them has a busted alternator. The other? No brakes. Despite being unable to start or stop, I've maintained the same driving job for the past decade. I'm always driving through the same neighborhoods meeting the same people every moment of every day. On top of all that, if Florida is considered America's anus, then I live in one of its hemorrhoids. But hey, all I need is an hour or two a day of wonderfully escapist adventures and I'm golden.

I was a fan of Test Drive Unlimited 1 on the Xbox 360. The handling wasn't particularly good, but the atmosphere and sense of exploration was excellent. With a few fixes, better graphics, and more content, it could be my ideal driving game. I'm not sure what I was expecting with the sequel. I read all of the reviews, noted that there are major problems such as Securom, dysfunctional servers, and so on. I considered the possibility that this game might not even work. But I gave it a shot anyway...

...I'm at a party...alright..cool I guess. Apparently I'm a woman now. It's just like Skyrim except I'm wearing clothes and I don't think I have a six-foot-long p-.
""PepsimanVsJoe! Enjoying your birthday party?""
Oh It's my birthday? I had no idea. Apparently I'm a silent-protagonist so all I can do is smile.
""Come check out your gift! It's a brand new car!""
No way! This is one of those end-game vehicles. I must be dreaming. This is so totally meta.

Sure enough the real game begins, I lose my job, only to get an offer to join a racing group for some show called Solar Crown. This is so ridiculous. I head to the used car dealer for my first actual virtual vehicle. 

""HOLY SHIT!"" I say to myself.
The dealer? He has small hands. The driving school instructor? A regular Alex Smith. It's no wonder none of them have gone for a handshake, it would be like if I held up my finger so a baby could grab it. After sleep-driving through my first test I say ""Thank you very much."" to the instructor. Apparently I'm a very-thankful-and-not-quite-silent protagonist. The only words I ever say are to express gratitude. 

On the road, the handling is...well it's about as bad as TDU1. In my mind that's good enough, because I'm finally living the dream again, cruising through hundreds of miles of beautiful Ibiza, and eventually Hawaii. As with the previous game, everyone needs help getting around the islands. There's the drunk guy who wants me to speed, the sick girls that throw up if I slam on the brakes, the random woman who always calls me adorable, and...wait a minute. It's happening again isn't it? The same people, requesting me to do the same favors for them over and over. Don't they have anything to say? While I'm driving we could discuss those bonus features on DVDs, or what tiny-handed men are good for aside from making origami birds out of starburst wrappers. Instead it's always ""I'm going to be late!"" or ""I just broke a nail"" or ""Whoa ho! Look at that speed!""

The people I compete with are slightly more developed, but it's also a facade. Miami Harris is little more than an untimely Paris Hilton joke. Then there's the Wilder brothers. Oh look at us! We're so extreme...ly shallow! Tess Wintory never figures out her daddy issues. Her dad Stuart is just a useless old prick. If I'm expected to race against these jerks all the time, at least a little effort could have been expended to develop them. But who am I to talk? I have the least character development of all. Oh sure, I've bought several houses, over a dozen cars, and a couple wardrobes. I've also gotten plastic surgery so many times I've forgotten what I originally looked like. In fact I just got some work done earlier today. The nose wasn't right.

Aside from a few minor changes and additions, TDU2 isn't really much of a sequel. In some ways it's even a step back. Motorcycles are locked behind a DLC wall. The races are organized in a Grand Prix setup, with the winner being the person who attains the most points. However that model is dumped for the major championships races because....???? It doesn't make any sense. A casino would have been nice to hang out at, but that's also DLC. All of the other additions seem to be multiplayer-centric, which is pointless when half the people that buy this game can't even get it to work.

But does any of that truly matter to me? I got what I wanted right? My virtual fantasy of owning expensive cars, several houses (that I can't interact with), and free reign over a beautiful...but lifeless island. Lifeless except for the same 12-15 idiots who sit around impotently while I drive them around or beat them to the ground in the championships. Nearly 30 hours of this dream has become a nightmare, and I suspect that it won't end anytime soon.

So where we did leave off? Oh right...I was hurtling over the tallest cliff in Hawaii. Yes, I'm throwing it all away. Soon it will all be-

I hit the rocks, then the water...suddenly I'm back on the road again...my car is a little scratched but it isn't even wet. I knew it wouldn't work anyway, but can you blame me for trying?

9940,"It is a good game, but not remarkable.

This game is a linear action-platformer in a 2D plane with 3D graphics. Your character can walk, run, slide, jump, double-jump, wall-jump, climb walls and even hang and move on ceilings. This variety of movements opens up to a lot of exploration in the levels, and such exploration is rewarded with lots of in-game money and hidden collectibles. The in-game money can be used to buy upgrades and costumes.

The levels are huge, with plenty of side-corridors or side-paths where you can find items. Since I wanted to explore every inch of each level, I often got tired before reaching the end. Slightly shorter levels (i.e. splitting each level into two) would be good.

The combat has a fast short-range attack (which you will end up using almost all the time) and a long-range attack, as well as a couple of gimmicks (left-trigger + short attack, or right-trigger on top of an enemy) that are a harder to pull off, and slow down the action as the camera freezes in a bullet-time fashion. This kind of effect gets old very quickly and breaks the flow of action.

The character has a stamina meter (for stuff such as running) and a health meter. The health regenerates when not taking damage.

Due to the amount of buttons used (4 buttons and the 2 triggers used as digital input), it might be a bit cumbersome to play on keyboard. I can't say about it, because I used a controller.

Although each level is huge, the game is a bit short, as this was meant to be the first episode in a multi-episode saga. And the storytelling in this game is not very good, I had the impression the levels did not follow any logical order, I haven't seen connection between most levels.

Combat is clunky and it is easy to get stun-locked to death by enemies. But by that same token, there's no challenge, as you respawn with no penalty and checkpoints are incredibly common. The sword selection is passable, but the only other upgrades are HP and Stamina ups, and nothing really unique. You CAN dress your character in a selection of very stylized japanese costumes if you like, but once you realize you're playing in pajamas and bunny slippers, it loses its appeal. The worst part is the voice acting, however. The protagonist never misses a chance to spout squeaky cutsesy dialogue in a voice that grates on the ears. I stopped hunting down treasure chests because I couldn't stand to hear another ""Win Get!"" or ""Awwwwwlright!"" It even does it when auto-aiming your jumps for you.

9940,"I think girls dressed up as cats are hot... There. I said it.
(Bonus points for the additional gothic dress for our cat girl heroine. Me-ow!)

Blade Kitten is a 2.5D, action-platforming game starring Kit Ballard, a cat girl (in an optional gothic dress) who controls a levitating AI sword and is followed around by some weird flying pet... thing, as she does battle against various factions out to get her while she tries to reclaim a data stick stolen from her and get payback for her destroyed ship. Or something. The whole story is a bit of a mess. There's very little real explanation for who anyone is or how they're all connected or ultimately what's going on. The story and apparent goal seems to shift dramatically from one level to the next with little real sense of focus for anything, just a vague over-arcing narrative that's sporadically dropped then brought up again at whim.

I presumed there was more to this than meets the eye and, indeed, found the game to be based on a web comic of the same name. It looks like it's been going for quite a while, but despite an intensive Google search for what must have been at least a good minute and a half, if not two whole minutes, I still couldn't really find out much about the material it's based on. The lack of explanation (aside from a brief in-game glossary) would suggest it's aimed at established fans, but if it's as obscure as it appears to be then that's a huge misstep and is essentially shooting itself in the foot from the start. The story elements aren't offensively bad or anything, and I guess you'll get the basic gist, but I just wish it would've kept its attention on one thing rather than feeling like it was cramming in every feature of its universe to appease fans who the developers probably thought would be annoyed if their favourite parts weren't included. The mostly useless pet, Skiffy, being a pretty glaringly obvious example of something from the lore being shoehorned into some kind of role in the game.

But despite the way it was presented, I did still really like the universe that we're shown (and the gorgeous art style in particular) and would be happy to learn more about it. I want to know more about this flying, AI sword, dammit! The lead is very well written and acted, and I never felt like the game was talking down to the player and treating us like idiots. In fact, the game, and Kit herself, come across as somewhat self-aware without ever breaking the fourth wall, and as a result feels far more inclusive and engaging. But as for the supporting cast? Mmm, not quite so much. They're more standard, video game fare.

The actual gameplay is far more successful, though. You'll run, leap and hack your way through 13 stages, searching for secrets, unlocking costumes and buying new swords and upgrades. But the main appeal of the game comes from Kit's agility and dexterity, as she sticks to just about every surface to climb along walls and ceilings, opening up huge potential for exploration. That's something that might actually throw some players, in fact. Most platformers are about running a gauntlet as you overcome obstacles of one kind or another to reach the finish. But in this one you'll spend far more time roaming the occasionally labyrinthine stages, sometimes wondering whether the path you've taken is where you're supposed to be going, or if you're unwittingly making your way towards the dead end with the collectibles. But once you know your way around and how to best deal with enemies (jump over them, innit), most of the stages can be speed run in around about five minutes.

When you are engaging in combat, you'll probably have a little less fun than when you're running around. There aren't a great deal of enemy types, and the majority of them will be dealt with in largely the same manner; either rush up to them with a flurry of light, but fast slashes, or send your floating sword off to deal heavy, ranged strikes. You can also jump on some enemies and toss them around, or do a jumping ground stomp attack for crowd control, but from moment to moment, you'll mostly just be cutting up the waves of fodder then running along. It's pretty trivial stuff for most of the game, thanks largely to your regenerating health as well. But, to be honest, I'd rather them be easy than have them kill the pace and become tedious roadblocks every time they're encountered. Also, the controls aren't quite tight enough for anything too challenging, either. Most of the time they're fine (I played it entirely with a game pad), but every so often it felt unresponsive and I'd suffer because of it. Was never too major, but enough to be a noticeable annoyance.

So, it's not perfect. The story is muddled, the combat and enemies are kinda uninspired and some more moves or combos would've been nice, the levels can sometimes confound, and the controls could be improved. But even so, I did still really enjoy this one and felt the fun and easy-going positives far outweighed the negatives. Especially the price. It's kind of a steal how much game you're getting for so little. So if you like platforming, exploring and cat girls in gothic dresses, then this has your name writing all over it. Well... at least if your name is Blade Kitten. Though I'm guessing it probably isn't, is it?",True,43

Crawling up walls, makes exploring the levels pretty fun, like any platformer its not the combat that makes the game its the controls, the feel, and the exploration.

9940,"As the game went on, I found myself increasingly disinterested in it. In fact, a few of the hours I've logged in this game have been spent on the pause menu as I got so bored I started doing other things instead.

The music is pretty good, and level design isn't half bad. At times it feels like a (good) Crash Bandicoot game, even to the point I'd call it fun! However, that's about all this game does well.

The game has a currency/upgrade system, which is fine until you realize there's only one weapon worth getting. Most of your money goes into stamina upgrades, as the alternate costumes are bland and uninteresting. Health upgrades should normally be as effective as stamina boosts, but the only times your health hits zero are instant-death situations.

Most of the combat in this game revolves around hitting the attack button until something happens. If you don't have the (very inexpensive, you can get it during the first level) final sword, almost every attack will bounce off and you have to use 'special' attacks which consist of swinging your sword out a bit further and sliding. There's also a ground-pound attack that takes far too much stamina to use.

Platforming in this game relies mostly on physics. That's not a good thing. You often find yourself stuck on a wall, pushed through the level, or outright unable to run and jump. The game has an aspect of velocity to it that doesn't make much sense in an action platformer. The entire game feels like a poorly programmed ice level with a stamina bar.

Nitpicking time? Nitpicking time. There's a section at the end of the game where you're forced to climb long sections of walls while flying bugs attack you. Being attacked while climbing makes you fall. There are enemies with shields that can deal minor damage while stunlocking you, and if there are two surrounding you then you'd better hope you didn't buy any health upgrades. It's best just to run past them as you need to use a special grab attack to take away their shield. Special attacks take stamina, also known as the make-the-game-go-by-faster meter.

The final boss is well designed. Brings together a culmination of the game's essentials: climbing, running, jumping, and attacking. However it's heavily dampened by the horribly annoying four or so lines of dialogue being constantly spewed and the fact that all of the things I just mentioned are broken. I ended up exiting the game and watching the ending on youtube for a sense of finality. The plot's not even that great, considering you have to read the (not so good by any means) comic series that the game neglects to tell you about.

Overall it's a good port in terms of additional content and playability, but you can't just paint a brick wall red and call it art.",False,31

9960,"At first the game seems easy, but its a pretty good puzzle game that revolves around the use of magical colored lanterns to open secret doors and find levers.  Not a long game, but hunting all the treasures which do nothing may be of interest?  The goal is to save Grandpa!!!  The bad part of the game is that the lanterns run out which can leave you trapped unable to complete a level, luckily their not long though so restarting isnt a big deal.  Poor instructions means going old school when getting into fights, just figuring out how to beat a boss, or an enemy, such as the last boss where you just drop a bunch of Holy hand Grenades, yep those are in the game, its fun.  Later levels are very dark testing your memory, providing a good challenge.  magical weapons in the game are a few, if you put them down they only reappear randomly once, so carry those through the whole game, except that eye of horus it appears a few times.

nostalgia:  Game is based on a very old atari 2600 cartridge which was played in a console that looked like it was made of wood, everything back then had wood grain.  In the original haunted House you ran around as a set of eyes with a light, they pull off the update nicely.

Now to the actual review.
This game is not worth you time or money.  It is a barebones experience without a ghost of a chance to be entertaining.  And yes, this game is worse than those puns I just made.  I came into this game wanting to enjoy it, and I came out sorely disappointed less than an hour later.  It is a boring, samey slog through tiring, repetitive levels.  The gameplay is so minimal that it utterly fails to entertain.  A clear lack of effort is evident in the subpar level design, outdated graphics, and poor gameplay.  I am glad I got this for dirt cheap through a sale, because payng any mre than 2 US dollars for this would be highway robbery.  When Valve finally gets around to implementing that refund policy, this is the first game I'm going to make use of it with.  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED AND BORED.",False,7
9960,"Atari Haunted House (Remastered) - A great concept, to some, a poor execution.

I am not sure how I honestly feel about that.  My love of all things classic, tells me that I should give this one a pass, however, my serious gaming side (as small as it may be), tells me be honest.  

What I have played of this game it is fun, once you get use to it, the fun novelty of it shines through, and what a great addition to anyone's library for the sake of Halloween and whatnot, honestly, I kind of like the feel of it, and like the updated graphics to the original Atari 2600 game I use to play as a kid makes me feel nostalgic, so yeah, I am sorry for anyone that expects a harsh review, but I just can't bring myself to do it, its a fun game to me, I recommend this one, its well worth the play, but definitely get it on sale if you still can!",True,6

When the original came out, the creators took what limited technology that had and created a genuinely creepy, highly memorable game. I recently revisited this game and I was pleased to see that the original game has held up nicely throughout the years.  To me it was one of the best classic Atari games ever released.
So how did the reboot hold up? Ehh, so-so; While this game wasn't terrible, it wasn't necessarily good either.  It just seems that they could have done more with it.
 Wait until this goes on sale for $2.99 and get it then.

Hehe, another silly little indie game that's decent enough to pass time.. you run around in a haunted house and try to not get caught by monsters as you try to solve the mystery of the haunted house. You don't get regular attacks-per-se... just stuff you can sometimes do with a torch or what-not. It's a fun little time killer. I never delved far into the game though since at the time I was playing the Ghostbusters game which is a more badass game about ghosts... but still, I'll recommend this game for the fact that it's cheap and decently challenging.",True,5

9970,"Star Raiders was one of my favorite games on the old Atari 8-bit systems. Packed into a measly 8K of ROM was a surprisingly detailed and complex space dogfighting game. When I saw that Atari was releasing an updated version for the PC, I was both excited and wary. All too often companies dig up a popular title from their vaults and try to squeeze more money out of it (anyone remember Knight Rider 2000?)

Alas, that's exactly what Atari has done with Star Raiders. This version of the game is about as unlike the original as you could possibly get while still flying a space fighter. Now it has a story, it's mission-based, the fighter can transform into different modes and there are cutscenes. There are also a number of new types of enemies to fight, including capital ships. I never got to a point where I could go into hyperspace or use the Galactic Chart or Long Range Scanner, if those things even exist in the game. While the original Star Raiders managed to squeeze the entire game into a mere 8,192 BYTES, this new version weighs in at nearly a full gigabyte.

Graphics are OK, if rather uninspired. It seemed a bit hard to figure out what I was looking at sometimes, with dark ships against the dark background of space, but fortunately enemies have boxes around them so you can always figure out where you need to shoot. The game really looks like a direct port from the X-Box.

The biggest flaw with Star Raiders is the horrendous controls. I could not get the game to recognize the rudder, throttle or hat controls on my Microsoft Sidewinder Precision Pro joystick. It also wouldn't recognize the additional buttons on my Logitech G700 gaming mouse or my Logitech Dual Action gamepad. Without the rudder or throttle, attempting to fly with the joystick is impossible, while trying to fly with the mouse felt like I was piloting a Mack truck through molasses. Keyboard? Don't make me laugh.

As far as gameplay, I really wouldn't know. I couldn't make it past the third tutorial because the controls were so utterly abysmal I couldn't track the enemy fighters to shoot them down. It might have been an interesting game if the controls actually worked.

UnderGarden is more about relaxation, exploration, and having something nice to look at on the screen.

When I bought the game, I initially played it through the first level before setting it aside and going to a new game. This itself was not in a lack of interest, but to another video game that took said interest.


It was my girlfriend at the time who found interest in the game and began playing it. Now, I had been playing some games that stress my hardware, but this game was no where near the extent of the other games at the time.

Hence my surprise when my PSU exploded when she was playing this game. Typically, I would have excused this as a hardware issue on my part and would have not had any discomfort with the ownership of the game... Until it happened again. And again. Strike three was where I decided to make a sub category entitled, ""Games of Shame,"" that includes games that are either unplayable or that I just don't typically like, and placed the game into said category.

The ghosts repeat themselves, the bellhop ghost makes sense in the hotel level, but what is it doing in the Sewers, or in a sanitarium?  The game feels like its made by third graders, or some comp sci project for an undergrad more than an actual game.  

The core mechanic of the game revolves around shooting different colored beams at different colored enemies.  This would be interesting except when all those colors are on screen at once, making the core game mechanic annoying.   No patch, and no bug fix will fix the core game mechanic of the game being annoying.  But hey the game has a high score counter!  in fact your not allowed to finish a mission until you smack the keyboard entering random letters to show off your high score.  Must be made by devs who worked on old atari games because I guess they never got the memo that high scores dont matter in modern games.

The game has alright graphics, the controls are fluid and easy to use, and it's Ghostbusters...but other than that...man, this game is hurting.  The camera angles will get annoying really fast, the ghosts throughout the levels are jokingly easy to kill, especially when playing the single player because the AI locks on to them as they are spawning, except for the ""boss"" battles which is annoying in it's own way because they have a huge amount of health and kill you in one hit...Another small thing is the fact that you play as some no name, random ""new"" Ghostbusters because the original crew is just ""far too busy and tired"".  But you know what is the worst part...all of the small things aside...the game is meant for four player multiplayer but some brilliant person decided to make it local multiplayer.  Cramming four friends on one keyboard is just dumb, one person gets ASDW and the mouse and the rest have to figure out how to play around that person.  Luckily I have a wireless xbox controller and only ONE other person that wanted to play with me, so we were able to do it with little problem...but seriously, if I wanted to play with a few friends, this would just be ridiculous.

9990,"I heard this wasn't good, but being a Ghostbusters fan boy since 1984, I decided to give it a look anyway once it was sub-$5. Short version: It's not good.

You play as four Ghostbusters... but not Egon, Ray, Peter, or Winston. Four other Ghostbusters. The game was designed entirely with 4-player multiplayer in mind. On the consoles you could play online, but for PC they decided to remove that feature. Single player means 3 AI partners...

Here's how the game will go. Enemy attacks can knock you down sometimes in a single hit, and you have to wait for one of your partners to help you up. What will happen is that when you go down, then the AI Ghostbuster nearest you goes to help you, and they will be knocked down by that same enemy. Then the third one does the exact same. Then the last AI partner does the exact same thing. Game Over. This will happen every time.

The game has 12 stages in total and even on normal difficulty it can get quite challenging.  You have 3 different weapons at any given time.  Each weapon is color coded toward the enimies you are fighting.  There's Red, Blue, and Yellow guns.  Easily toggled between each other.  And the final weapon is the ghost trap.  These are only usuable on the end of stages bosses.  Who ever throws the trap out gets a mini quick time event challenge in order to trap the ghost.  It's not hard and it awards the player with more points.

Each stages story progresses from the last in a comic book style story telling including the end game credits.

10090,"After Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, Call of Duty: World at War saw the franchise return to its WWII roots, and man, what a return! This game feels like a truly cinematic experience; a blockbuster of gaming, so to speak, packed with non-stop action.

In what seems to be a staple of the franchise, at least when it comes to WWII games, the campaign follows a couple different characters, focusing on different fronts of the war. The American side of the campaign follows the Marines' assault on Japanese bases across the Pacific, while the Soviet campaign begins with Stalingrad (which seems to be a staple for this franchise), and goes on to the final march on Berlin, and the storming of the Reichstag. While most of the campaign missions play as a traditional FPS, there's a couple of vehicle missions mixed in; in the Soviet side of the campaign, you get to drive a tank, while on the American side, you're a crewmember of a combat plane.

Graphically, I'd say the game has aged well, though sometimes the different smoke effects, or the ""bloody screen"" (so real!), made it difficult to distinguish enemies. This was particularly annoying during the tank mission, as you'd get shot from all over the place, and your view would end up obscured. Still, it's a nice looking game for its age, and the design of the levels themselves is great; from the islands full of jungles of the Pacific, to the grey streets of Stalingrad or Berlin, the game looks good.

Mechanically speaking, well, it's a CoD game. You're limited to two weapons, plus grenades; you can aim down sights for better shots (and you're able to steady your aim when using sniper rifles), and you can sprint for an extremely short while. The gun variety seems good, and it now includes shotguns, which I believe is a first for the WWII games. Still, most of the time during the campaing I found myself going after the automatic guns, as I found them more reliable. That could be down to personal preference, however.

A new aspect introduced in this game is the Zombies mode, which I believe is now as much of a staple of CoD as the killstreaks. It's basically a survival mode, as there's no shortage of zombies to kill, and while I did mess around a bit in it, I feel it might be better playing it with friends. Which brings me to one of the negatives about this game: multiplayer is broken. Now I don't personally care about MP games that much, but considering how popular CoD's MP modes are, it makes no sense for it to be broken. There are guides for getting it to work, but it seems they require getting a game key outside of Steam, which is ridiculous. People shouldn't be spending more money to get a game they bought into a playable state.

Overall, and despite the negative point I outlined above, I can say I recommend World at War for its campaign, which is what I mostly cared about.

I found that the legacy version of the install uses a badly configured implementation of dosbox which causes problems. eg: doesn't mount a suitable drive for saving your game, sets an incompatible screen resolution etc..

I installed the standard version and then edited the launcher's ini file to add an extra button that launches the newer vga version of sq1. I had to create an extra .conf file and move and rename some other files but now it works well and I have both the old and new versions of sq1 in my launcher.",True,9

Graphics:
Great, even despite it's age. Lot's of details here and there make the visuals stand out. They are colorful with wonderful bloom type of effects. Very pleasing to the eyes.

Sound:
Music is servicable to good. Sound effects are very pleasing to the ears and fit the visuals meticulously and methodically. 

Gameplay:
Frantic, fun - has that I want to try another level or one more time feeling. So it's all gooood! :-)

Con:
No way to save your progress.. you have to start over each time.. grrr!

Overall:
Highly recommended. Too bad there is no co-op or pvp, it would have been awesome fighting from one end of the universe to meet each other in the middle.. ahh well..

Can't ALT/TAB, because the instant you change windows, the game takes back over again.

Activision has no reference to this game on their site anywhere, and you can't submit a ticket for anything that's not on the site.

As multiple operating systems and hardwares have changed, I did have to set Affinity to 0-1-2-3 cores only to make this run, otherwise it ran nearly flawlessly (I9-12900k, RTX3080 Strix, Z690 Strix).  I had one point near the end where there were a dozen tanks, aerial enemies and the mechsuit-like jerkfaces everywhere and whenever the mechsuit guys would grab me it would slow down a bit; not choppy or anything, just like slow motion almost but _only_ in that scenario, so I'm not sure if it was intentional or not.  Otherwise, again basically flawless operation.  No other hoops to jump through like you read about on here, just drop it to first 4 cores only and its good to go.
I'm glad to have come back to it, I recall spending a lot of time just running around consuming people the first time and never really getting into the core missions.  It was a fun and engaging ~15 hours or so.  I could go longer doing all the challenges (I did literally one this time lol), but I did a bunch of them years ago when I got it and didn't see much point, as the missions alone will get you enough XP to get 95% of the upgrades anyway.

I had read the reviews and wasn't expecting much, but when I saw the game on sale for less than 4 dollars I thought I would give it a go. I am glad I did.

Some aspects of this game are really great, others are awful.

The artwork is fabulous and it helps the game exude atmosphere. It reminded me of 'Evil Under the Sun' with a bit of 'Black Mirror 1' and 'Syberia' thrown in, but in the mountains. The hotel was a dream to explore as it is huge and would be a fantastic place to stay. I loved the short sections outside, with the snow falling. The artists did a fab job.

Difficulty is not too tough. I only needed to check a walkthrough once, when I couldn't fathom how to lure the owner out of his office. 

Kaisa is certainly very cute.

The music is lovely for the most part, though a couple of horrendous rock pieces come in at odd moments and not just when entering the room of a particular character.

Gameplay is ok, with a clear changing cursor.

Now for the bad. The story  is a real slow boiler, which is a good thing as it sets the scen beautifully and allows us to get to know the characters. However, when the main events finally happen, the story just ends. I had the most nonsensical ending  to a game ever and though there are different endings none make a lot of sense, with an absolutely ridiculous twist at the end. So the game takes a good few hours to brew and then when something big finally happens, it ends. Crazy. It is like the developers suddenly lost interest to continue the plot.

The translation is poor, though understandable. Sometimes it appears that characters give a comnpletely different answer to the question being asked. The voicees being better than the inaccurate subtitles. It's crazy that the developers didn't get someone who can understand proper English to check the translation. The character voices range from ok (the main character, Kaisa, and Olga) to horrendously bad (Alec, for instance). Also the voices are obviously done with the actor not having a clue as to the context in which they are supposed to be said. A basic error.

So, I am going to recommend this title as parts of this game are very enjoyable indeed, though the ridiculously abrupt and silly ending ruins the experience in the end.",True,38
10230,"Dead Mountaineer's Hotel is a game based on the novel of the same name by the Strugatsky brothers, the generally pretty great Russian sci-fi authors who also wrote books like Roadside Picnic, which was the basis of the movie which was in turn the basis of the STALKER series. I've never read this particular book, but I figured anything related to them couldn't possibly turn out that bad. I was horribly wrong, but I don't need to tell you that, because I doubt anyone was actually planning on buying this game to begin with. But I'm going to go over it anyways because I need a therapeutic rant session to recover from playing it.

The first thing you'll notice within five seconds of starting the game is that the voice acting is absolutely terrible. Just listen to the opening dialogue of the game, and you'll see what I mean: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRYvubs4MQs . Well, actually the first thing you'll notice is that despite originally releasing in 2007 the game only runs in one resolution, and it's 1024 x 768 and cannot be changed, but still. There are one or two actors who border on decent, but for the most part the game sounds as if they hired a bunch of bums off the street and paid them in bread to do the voice acting for the game. It's kind of hilarious, and was mainly what kept me playing through the game, but it also made the story impossible to take seriously.

Luckily, there really isn't much story. Again, I've never read the novel this was based off of, but I highly doubt it went quite like this. You spent the first four or five hours of the game doing absolutely nothing relevant to the plot, mainly involving stupid puzzles like helping the hotel owner fix the room service call system that never gets used again, or choosing a dinner from various categories that doesn't cause the other guests to laugh at your choice (I don't know why having too many vegetables in your meal is grounds for making you redo a ""puzzle"", but what do I know?), or playing billiards with another character that isn't even really a puzzle so much as just a billiards flash game implanted into the game. Then in the last 20 minutes or so of the game the story finally starts, you talk to each of the hotel's residents, and then it ends, and the game explains the story to you. 

As you might have gathered from that last bit, the store page is pretty misleading. It mentions ""15+ hours of gameplay"", but I finished it in less than 6 and I can't imagine it taking 15 hours unless you just get lost in the unnecessarily large hotel. The store page also makes it seem as if the hotel guests have AI routines and go about their own lives, hinting at a system something like how Deadly Premonition's characters go about their day, but the game doesn't have any sort of time system and the characters just move from place to place as you solve the puzzles like in any adventure game.

Pros:
Nice music
Nice graphics for when the game was made
The suspense
Some of the puzzles

Cons:
The awful voice acting
Bugs/glitches later on in the game
The dialogue
Slow movement 
Some objects being almost impossible to find

So sorry if you think every game should look like Call of Duty, or be as slick as Life Is Strange. Maybe stick to a handful of very limited AAA titles, yeah? Leave the gaming to actual gamers.

I actually enjoyed it, in spite of all it's quirks. The scenery and the hotel  were beautiful , even though a bit empty, with very little with which to interact . The characters are all very different . They  modernly included a gender ambivalent character but then made the female characters absurdly massively bosomed(this latter,  I guess, to entertain the stereotypical male player)  It's a classic point and click  game which is something many people don't take into account. Yes some puzzles were annoying; for example, the pool/snooker game .   I,  like many others players, could NOT win this (which one has to, the obtain a certain ending)in spite of trying over and over and over...lol However it was possible to play on, to an ending which was ok.

There are 4 different endings to this game so that is the one thing i found enjoyable. It was really hard to understand were to go and what to do in the game while playing since the dialogue didn't give much hint to it. The graphics were decent for how old this game looked and played. The music came in at the worst times. The only mini game that was enjoyable with this game was billiards, but that had its downfall due to the computer having mad skills when it needed them.

Sadly, it proved nearly unplayable. Someone experienced with this sort of game may do fine, but I struggled to figure out what I was supposed to do and eventually gave up. You have to do so many boring tasks to get something simple done, as if they tried to prevent the game from being to short, instead of making a better longer game. Example (MINOR SPOILERS): struggle to set up spy camera with correct lens (no instructions given), tripod too low for view out of window (seriously?), go back to office and search for taller tripod, try camera again only to find steam from leaky pipe in nearby building blocking view, find someone to fix pipe...take photo...develop photo (no instructions given), give photos to your boss who does not accept them because you apparently had to take more photos (this was never made clear). The game is full of this, tedious and not enough guidance or help. The voice acting is very mediocre (why get sleepy americans to do german voices?). There were also some problems with screen resolution and loading crashes. All in all a pity, as this game clearly had some potential, with great and historically authentic looking visuals.

I think it would help the player to know a little German history from the WWII era, the narration goes into a lot of detail about specific personalities from that time.

Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone who likes adventure/quest games.",True,11
10240,"Very nice game in general, with an original historical background. You play a  SS Standartenfuhrer, who chooses to get involved in a plot to assassinate Hitler, using his authority in the Gestapo. What called my attention is that the character you play -intentionally or not- is not the typical ""good guy"". He's far from noble, actually. His main reason for being disenchanted with Hitler was that he saw [i]Germans[/i] in the concentration camps (apparently he was cool with it when it was only the Jews). Mild mild spoiler (not really, but just in case: [spoiler]He doesn't care about exposing the conspirators to his superior, saving only who can be useful to him in the future, or about accusing an ""innocent"" man as communist because he was in his way, even after he stated that his motivation came from seeing Germans in the camps solely for being communists or personal enemies to people in power[/spoiler]. This is unusual, and was very interesting for me during the gameplay.

THE GOOD:
+ Nice visuals, with beautiful artwork in the cut scenes.
+ Excellent attention to detail, especially with historical elements.
+ The music isn't overwhelming or annoying; sound effects are cool.
+ Different dialog options. It doesn't change the main outcome, but you may learn more or less, according to what you choose.
+ The plot was believable, historically accurate within the context of this fictional little story, and made sense.

THE NOT SO GOOD:
* Two of the ""mini-games"" inserted in the game are exclusively about luck, rather than skills, and losing them may block your game, forcing you to use a previously saved game.
* The first mini-game was quite poorly explained.
* The game has you picking up stuff you don't need at the moment. This is a common trait of most point-and-click games, but it kind of spoils the immersion.
* Voice acting was... not that good. Some characters were ok, others less so.
* Even though the main plot was somewhat solved, many point were left open in the hopes of part 2. But let's hope!

THE HORRIBLE:
- The pronunciation of German words was preposterous, especially by certain characters. Every time someone said ""Wehrmacht"", I felt like someone was scratching a blackboard. Note that I'm not German, and I'm cool with actors pronouncing ""Gestapo"" instead of ""Geshtapo"", but some of it was too bad even for me.
- The woman who did the voice of ""Victoria"". That was the worst part of this game, and the worst I ever heard. I heard kids in elementary school reading from history books better than this lady did her lines. PLUS: she pronounced the word ""Fuhrer"" as ""fur-r"", and that wasn't the worst part of her ""acting"".

- Sometimes you get the 'being there' feeling.

- Detailed guns and boats and crew. 
- Good enough UI once you learn it's quirks. 
- Good enough and fun enough management of destroyers and other ships under your command if you got any. 
- Good looking smoke - when it decides to stay visible. 

Bad
- UI is rough in the corners. also forget about modern day markers telling you exactly what to do - instead listen closely what the instructions are and follow them - or try to work yourself around them. (i.e. go to sector G-7 and look for a convoy - how about going north of that and trying to look there first where they might be heading)
- Damage models - i dont understand what determines who wins and who loses fights between PT boats. sometime crew fly around after direct hit. sometimes you can dump a lot of ammo on an enemy and still go down with the fishes. 
- Better like restarting missions all the time. Allies first mission took me some 10 tries. (mission does randomize convoy consists (?) and locations a bit so every mission is slightly different even if you retry the same mission over again). 
- Missions are locked and you can only advance through the hard way - Hard to say how much content there really is here  - 3 tutorials in the beginning though that you really should do.",True,40

Now the game features.

There are 3 tutorial missions, and 54 missions in campaign.

Weserübung: 1940, 5 missions, Germany and Great Britain.
English Channel: 1940, 5 missions, Germany and Great Britain.
Cold Waters: 1943, 4 missions, Germany and Soviet Union.
Land under sight: 1944, 4 missions, Soviet Union.

Routine service: 5 missions, Germany, Allies and Soviet Union.
Bonus missions: 2 missions, Germany, Allies and Soviet Union.

You control a PT Boat,  you can change stations, artillery, machine guns, torpedo launcher and helmsman.
You will have control of other ships, minesweepers, destroyers, etc however you can only take the helmsman role you can't directly fire their weapons.

A nice variety of missions, attack convoys, defend convoys, collect intel, search and attack bases, etc.

Some missions are very short maybe 10-15 minutes and others can reach 1 hour, you can't save in the middle of the missions so be careful.

Additionally disconnect other screens using windows own 'Display Settings'. You can enable them again after game. Now you dont have cursor running away to other screen.

The combat itself is heavily action-based with little real strategy involved, and the more memorable aspect of this game for me was actually the choices between whether or not to cybernetically enhance myself.

However, the enemies shoot back at you, and your only way to avoid getting shot is to roll dodge, and you have to aim it with the mouse in the direction you want to roll. So somehow you have to manage to shoot and roll dodge at the same time with just 1 mouse. And then we also get the annoying camera rotation, which is inverted. When I want to rotate left, it rotates right, and vice versa. Maybe there's a way to change this, but I didn't see it.

You get a robot companion too, but it's just a regular sidekick really who acts as an extra gun in battle. You can give him a few basic commands, like attack, defend, and heal, and you can upgrade his stats just as you can upgrade your own, but there's nothing much else to it. You can probably play the whole game without ever using it.

You can also get cyber implants and use skill points to improve your abilities, but it's all presented in a very generic and uninteresting way. Nearly every skill is a passive which just improves your damage or a critical chance by a couple of % and that's it. Not to mention, half of the abilities require you to have a specific cyber implant, and from what I've played so far, I've only found the one for the eye, so there are plenty of abilities in my upgrades menu that I can't use yet, and no idea when I will.

The fact that enemies all look and act alike, makes every single battle feel the same. Throw a couple of grenades into the group and fire away till naught's left. Rinse and repeat. But then fighting enemies isn't so bad when you consider that 95% of the time you're walking and backtracking with nothing happening.

You might enjoy this game if you're into dungeon crawlers with no story and simply need to play every single one out there, but otherwise I wouldn't really recommend it.",False,10

It's clearly a Gas Powered game, remnants of the previous Dungeon Siege ""surprise mechanics"" are present though this is quite different in terms of combat as you're in full control rather than watching and managing.  I would have preferred a leveling system and random gear than the linear progression the game provides, that would have allowed much more flexibility though I can see where it wouldn't make much sense given how short the game is.  If I had one complaint it would be that the game feels like one big marketing campaign for the period sensitive Ageia PhysX, while that was entertaining at first there was so much of it that I couldn't help but think the game was made for PhysX rather than it being a feature of the game.  Nevertheless I'm glad I played it, it was certainly entertaining for the 10 hours it took to complete.  If you're a fan of the late Gas Powered Games then you likely enjoy this as well.",True,9

10530,"I played this game a long time ago and i only had to load it once to remember why i stopped playing back then.
In the basics this is an RPG lite game. 
That means that it is an action game with some RPG elements like skills and leveling.
In a way the controls feel like Dungeon Siege.
Only that had a good story and never got boring..

When playing this at first i was happy with the game.
After a few hours things got really repetive and in the end i stopped playing and moved on to other games.
The problem is that after a while you feel like there is no progress.
Not in the gameplay and the graphics that are mostly made of the same textures and grey colours.
Combine that with a B like storyline and i in the end couldn't care less anymore.
It's not that the game is really bad but compared to what Chris Taylor has done before and after this game, it is mediocre and to simple.
Go play the first two Dungeon Siege games, Supreme Commander and Demigod and you'll figure this out pretty quickly.
I'd give this game a rating of 5,5 out of 10.

So the conclusion is this isn't really a bad game.
Graphics are decent, sound ok, the story mediocre and the gameplay is repetive. 
After a while you'll probably loose interest in this one and not return.

Admittedly, I can't really attest to the usefulness or lack thereof of the USS Constitution and HMS Victory. In terms of how the DLC impacts your campaign, the effectiveness is admittedly somewhat dependent upon which faction you're playing as. All factions have access to Ghoorkas and Dahomey Amazons (both of which are admittedly useful in multiplayer, especially the amazons). The Ottomans benefit greatly from the Organ Guns which can be recruited very early in the game and really do dish out devastating damage. Organ Guns are however, virtually useless in multiplayer. As for Rogers Rangers and Bulkeley's Regiment, they don't have a huge impact on campaign. They're relatively easy to recruit but you can only have one. In multiplayer, both Roger's Rangers and Bulkeley's Regiment are fairly useful.

10604,"This is my favorite DLC for Empire. Playing as the US, I got tired of London constantly declaring war on me, so I sailed over the pond and quickly annexed England. Naturally, the other Britonnians weren't too pleased with me, and seeing as how they held Scotland And Ireland in addition to four powerful navies still in those docks (Strange, I came up from the south with my fleet and landed my army, they never caught my fleet as it fled back west), I knew that any chance of holding London was to dig in and declare war with the bluff of threatening Scotland. 
This in itself worked out to my advantage, as they took the bait, allowing me to replenish my troops quell the populace and draw forth regiment upon regiment of stalwart newly minted ""American Englishmen"" to help secure my half of the Island. Depositing Pulaski's cavalry (Excellent shock value if you charge them from behind) with 8 support cavalry regiments onto the island, I moved them up north and sent a force compromising of  my general, 2 regiments of US Marines, 6 regiments of Guards, the New York, the Delaware, 2 units of rangers and the rest line infantry to straddle the area outside of the Scotland provinces capital and establish a fort. Upgrading that fort to have artillery forts surrounding the main fort, I moved up my cavalry force so it was inside the reinforcement zone, and then moved up 12 regiments of line infantry to support it. 
Britain declared war on me 2 turns later as I finished off both the Iriquois, Choctaw, the forces of Spain in the continental US, Mexico (MEXICO!!! I didn't even KNOW that Mexico could be formed! As soon as their nation was created, I was so overjoyed I sailed over and killed them off) and the remnants of Britain provinces in Canada.

They attacked my fort in England with 4 armies comprising of over 7400 men while I was defending with a paltrier 5200. 
My US Marines saved the day, holding off the northern wall as over 800 men attempted to assault 2 regiments of 120 men. The Line infantry broke and retreated over the corpses of their comrades back to the Union Jack's lines, as the enemy guard advanced under withering musket fire and percussion shells desperately being fired in their direction. As they climbed the wall, they met the fierce charge of continental Marines angrily bayoneting them, remember my previous assault on London which cost me a whole regiment of Marines when I attempted to scale the walls with Line Infantry and Marines.

The final tally was 600 dead enemies to my 221 Marines. One regiment had only 16 men left, the other only 3, yet with my general and Guards in close proximity along with their integrity they never retreated. Oorah! 

I heartily suggest this pack if you love Marines, or just seeing hordes of corpses surrounding your units. You could bum rush them with line infantry, but really? Would you REALLY NOT use Marines if they were available?",True,26
10604,These units do not have a significant impact on the gameplay (maybe for the better) and there are too few per faction to matter anyway.,False,16
10604,"The units are top notch and this is a good DLC. As a rule of thumb, the units are capped at 1, in terms of how many you can recruit. Certain ones (Hungarian Grenadiers, Freikorp, Legion of the United States) can be recruited in greater numbers. In some cases, the elite units can be recruited very easily, which is helpful on a campaign level, and others can be recruited in bulk which again, is very helpful on a campaign level. In terms of multiplayer usefullness, these units will undoubtedly give your armies quite a bit of extra punch, which is important, obviously.

It is also very good for campagin and gives more unit variety to factions

It also adds the most powerful cavalry unit the Gard de Chevel. Along with other powerful cavalry units like British horse guards and Dutch garde de corps and 2nd Hussars

10606,The natives are not overpowered as they are in the standard campaign. Because of this you really have to use weight of numbers and guerrilla tactics. Very good DLC.,True,80
10606,"Balance is non-existant in the Warpath expansion/DLC, do not waste your money on this lackluster excuse for an expansion.",False,78
10606,Well I saw some negative reviews on this game so I will give my review. I like this game. As a student of history and fan of Allen W. Eckert's books I liked this game. You are weaker than the European powers which is accurate. You need to use new tactics (think like an indian). I could tell you but I found it fun to figure them out on my own. I have won with every tribe. I even lost with Peublo because I ran out of time. I enjoy the chance of losing.,True,43
10606,"The Warpath Campaign. Some love it, others hate it. I personally highly recommend picking it up. It is a decent game and will provide you with tons of fun, provided you don't take it too seriously. It has a lot of faults, incuding random freeze-ups, lag, and an overall bad AI. But the Warpath campaign is not like the grand campaign. In the grand campaign, yuo could dominate the battlefield with a few untis of line-infantry and a couple of cavalry units. But in this campaign, there is none of that. Basically, all you've got are clubs and bows against muskets, cannons, and bayonets. 
This handicap is what makes it so fun. You actually need to think out your strategy and use every advantage you have, because if you just charge forward with your infantry, you'll get gunned down and slaughtered to a man. You are forced to use guerilla tactics and make the most of your units.
As such, this DLC is highly worth it in my opinion, despite its numerous faults and defects. As long as you are relaxed and do not take it too seriously, this is the game for you.

10606,"CONS.
-Indians speak english like Tonto from Lone Ranger.
-Some details seem to be missing, there are more graphics for the popups in Empire vanilla than in the warpath campaing.
-Tech tree is not really interesting, and biased (ie, based on western prejudices more than in real native american mythology).
-The music feels halfmade, and gets very repetitive quickly.

-Many different playable nations.
-Great graphical detail.
-You can kick the crackers off Turtle Island!",True,30
10606,"This DLC adds a very different sort of gameplay. In the beginning the natives are not really friendly to eachother, but later in the game they are all you got. All you got to do is survive because of the difference in warfare with the Western faction. The lack of the European and Indian map here is no con for me, because you will mostly never be able to conquer the world with the native factions. I enjoy this actually more then the normal game, which i have played too many times",True,29

10606,"This is going to be a serious review as i genuinly love what this DLC has to offer (whilst the other DLC was more of a completionist thing). The campaign plays out very differnetly to that of the main campaign; i realised this upon my first battle with the Spanish, what would have been a normal advance, fire, fix bayonet  then 'CHARGE!' turns into a massacre of my men who only win by weight of numbers alone.  

Guerrilla tactics and weight of numbers are your ally here, whilst they are strong in combat, they lack any great over powered forces at range, meaning it can become a killing ground if you're not careful with unit control.

If you're like me, you will play the game to try and help the Native Americans get some revenge upon their oppressors in history; it's a fun bit of DLC, though its a damn hard campaign.",True,16
10606,"Empire Total War’s Warpath campaign is a strong candidate for being the worst DLC campaign for a Total War game. The Warpath Campaign has a complete lack of content, terrible gameplay, and has clearly had little research put into it. 

The Warpath campaign is not even worth trying at its current price of free because it simply has nothing to offer. This DLC’s map is just an exact copy of the Americas section of the grand campaign as its own campaign, but with only indigenous factions as playable. This campaign is technically the first 19th century Total War game, but there are no special events, mechanics, technologies, or even characters that make that noticeable or special. The UI has its own native-like aesthetic, and there is tribal chanting music (recycled from Medieval 2: Americas DLC?), but that’s not much. All of the opening introductions lack narrations, and worst of all the factions all look and feel the same. This DLC takes away mechanics like tax management, and governments systems so its campaign is especially bare bones.  Its so basic that there isn’t really much to mention. Its just so boring. 

The gameplay of this DLC is terrible and a lot of that comes from its lack of detail and content. Every faction not only looks the same but, plays the same. All factions primarily rely on cheap melee units like tribal levies, warriors, and some cavalry general unit. Due to weak economies, these units will be most of what is created and used by nearly every indigenous faction. These primitive units do well against the line infantry of the European powers due to melee units being powerful, but even fighting against Europeans is just fighting the same units over and over again. Some factions like the Pueblo are made special by being cavalry only factions, but that gets old fast. The gameplay is even more basic than then that of the base game and that is an accomplishment. The campaign is challenging, but its not enjoyable in the slightest. 

Expecting or even demanding that videogames be historically accurate is just silly, but there should be some accuracy so that the game at the very least captures the spirit of the era it claims to be representing. The historical accuracy of this DLC is especially abysmal even by the standards of videogames.  Guns were widespread even amongst peoples on the western plains for at least a century by this game start date of 1783. Nearly two centuries earlier native groups like the Iroquois had even been able to equip whole armies with guns through trade and create empires that threatened the Europeans. The fur trade that made that possible is few decades away from reaching its height so there is no reason for every native faction to be relying on stone age axemen and primitive bows for most of the game. Its so anachronistic that it should be no surprise that there are many negative reviews from people who are offended. 

This DLC magnifies every problem with Empire Total War. It lacks content, has bland gameplay, and has atrocious historical accuracy even by video game standards.  It also still has all of the bugginess, glitches, and AI problems of the base game. Its absolutely awful.

10607,"I'd recommend this pack for people who like to play multiplayer. It adds a bunch of good (balanced yet effective) but cost efficient units.

Some get extra powerful skirmishers, and some get dragoons, but that is it. All the factions are effectively using the same standardized armies and it is not even made slightly interesting like with Shogun 2 that gives factions different buffs. The Ottomans actually get faction diversity through various types of melee infantry, archers and region specific auxiliaries. This unit pack just gives them more of what makes them interesting.

Story:

Set after the events of Sherlock Holmes The Awakened, you again step into the shoes of the worlds greatest detective Sherlock Holmes. Holmes and Watson take on smaller jobs, but find themselves cross paths with Arsene Lupin, an infamous French thief that has set his sights on five important pieces of British history that he plans to steal and you set out to stop him before he does.

I really liked the story the story of The Awakened, it was the perfect amount of cheesy and creepy and I'm really disappointed to say that the story in Nemesis sucks. Plain and simple the central case is bland, there's an interesting premise here, but it falls short in many departments.

The biggest one is that every single character feels so much dumber than before. Watson especially feels like a totally different character from his Awakened counterpart as he does so much stupid stuff to advance the plot it's quite hilarious. Lupin is barely in the game and ends up being a rather forgettable villain which is rather disappointing cause he's a cool character on his own. There are some good moments, like a few funny jokes and some interesting twists and turns, but mostly it's forgettable.

Graphics:

Visually, Sherlock Holmes Nemesis did not stand the test of time. Visually it's not much different than Awakened and feels more like a DLC storyline instead of a fully fledged sequel. A lot of the environments you visit feel barren and dead and there's a lot of dead space that serves really no purpose. Also every specific location that's not Baker Street is way too big for it's own good, but more on that a bit later. 

Even though The Awakened is really rough around the edges, there was a ton of varied environments and actually fun to explore, this isn't much the case here. The locations you go to are boring and feel rather tacked on. Each location has a few interesting areas of to search, but that's about as far as it goes in the positivity department. 

Audio:

A good chunk of the voice actors return from Awakened to reprise their roles. The actors for Sherlock and Watson are again the ones that are the standouts while everyone else either does a passable job or falls flat on their face. I think mostly it's decent, but I can't say I was impressed. A lot of the characters have absurdly bad accents and it really goes into the over the top mode anytime they speak, this especially goes for the female characters in the game.

The music and other sound effects sound fine enough. There's nothing really all too amazing, but it's a decent classical score that really fits the theme of Sherlock Holmes and provides decent listening while you're hammering away at the puzzles. 

Gameplay:

Just like The Awakened, Sherlock Holmes Nemesis is the remastered version (In some places and even in the main menu it's called Sherlock Holmes Versus Arsene Lupin) which allows you to play the game as a standard point and click adventure game or switch to a FPS mode which allows you to play through the eyes of Sherlock, but either way it's an adventure game at heart. 

The basic gist is this. As Sherlock you go around your environments looking for clues, items and other stuff that will help you in the case against Lupin and of course tons of puzzle solving. So let's begin with the most important aspect the puzzles and they suck. Well not all of them, but most of them.

A lot of puzzles range from absurdly easy to obtuse and annoying. There's really no middle ground and I got really tired by the half way mark. There are some pretty fun puzzles like the one where you have to find away to get birds back at the Tower of London or finding the missing dolls at the Royal Palace. However a good range of puzzles feel tedious than others. 

The most annoying aspect is how much grounds you have to cover between puzzles. Each location is massive and while there is a fast travel it won't save you that much time as you have to keep walking between multiple spots. To give you an example in the Museum section you keep tagging between three locations, Get item in place A, go to B to get a clue and then go to C to get a clue which sends you back to A to restart the loop and do this until that section is clear. 

This is why playing in point and click mode is pointless, you will be mashing that mouse button to move and it will get tiring, so if you intend to play the game, do it in FPS mode to save yourself some head pain. Now it's not all bad. The game is fun when it gets fun. Like I mentioned before there's some cool puzzles and exploring still feels great, but it feels like a massive downgrade after the immense step up that was The Awakened. 

Verdict:

Sherlock Holmes Nemesis is a okay-ish adventure with the titular detective, but feels a bit weak after the strong prequel. it still has it's merits that will likely satisfy fans of the British sleuth, but I'd recommend grabbing this on a sale or better yet, just go with The Awakened. 

Final Rating:
6.5/10

Pros:
+ Story has some pretty funny moments
+ Some of the puzzles are really fun
+ Music is pretty good

Cons:
- Tons of backtracking between multiple areas 
- The actual Storyline feels boring and bland 
- Tons of incredibly annoying puzzles

11130,"Humble, yet rough start.

Story:

You play as the legendary detective Sherlock Holmes. After the death of Lord Montcalfe his daughter Elisabeth has called in a request to figure out the circumstances of his death, but when you arrive you find that the case is a lot more complicated and sinister than first thought. 

The storyline overall is fine enough, but it's rather rough at places. There's generally not much interesting stuff going in the plot until the final few sections of the game when the revelations start creeping in. The first half of the game feels very poorly paced and doesn't do enough to make they mystery entertaining even though it has a really interesting opening level.

Graphics:

The graphics aged about as gracefully as milk left under a radiator. The environments look very rough although there's a good chunk of variety, from personal museums, basements and even tombs. However nothing looks particularly pleasing to look at, there's a lot of blurry environments and the game only manages to run consistently when the resolution is very low which causes the biggest problem in the game which is item hunting.

Many of the items you need to solve puzzles are such small pixels that sometimes finding them is borderline impossible. In one of the levels you need to find a hairpin and because of the blurry textures and how small the item is you can basically walk over it multiple times and not even spot it without a help of a walkthrough.

Audio:

The audio design is also pretty bad, from voice acting to music to other sound effects it's just all pretty bad. I'll begin with voice acting which sort of falls into the so bad it's good territory. The actor for Sherlock tries his best, but definitely fails with some of his lines, everyone else is twenty times worse.

The music is also so obnoxious it actually gave me a headache in the final level and if I ever have to hear the Level 4 music  again I think I would rather stab myself in the ears to never have to listen to it ever again, it's that bad. The other sound effects are also very low quality.

Gameplay:

The Mystery of the Mummy is a point and click adventure game where you go around looking for items to solve various puzzles. So just like most puzzle games the saving grace usually falls into the puzzles and well sad to say that this is one bland game in the puzzles department and in many others.

The puzzles themselves are pretty easy for the most part. Usually you will find a place that is missing an item and you need to bring it over to use it. However the real difficulty is the absurd locations for some of the items. Stuff is just randomly tucked away and you have to look through every corner and crack to find stuff you need. 

Puzzle design itself is incredibly bad. There's multiple incredibly obnoxious puzzles which took me upwards 30 minutes a piece. There's two picture sliding puzzles which were really bad, but then in the final level there's one puzzle where you have to assemble a picture bit by bit and it's so incredibly annoying which took me forever to do because of the mouse controls.

The way you move around the mansion is awful. You have to place the mouse on the side of the screen where you want the camera to twist and that barely works and then you have to move in really bizarre patterns to even reach a door at the end of a straight hallway, it's just so insanely tedious.

And above all that, the worst thing about the game is the performance and technical issues. It's an old game so modern hardware will have problems, but I've not seen something this bad in forever. I doubt many of you have the patience for this, but it took me an hour to get this game to run and even then I had to invert the mouse which really made certain puzzles absurdly difficult and it crashes after every level which was the icing on the cake. So if you do play this game, save frequently and use multiple slots, cause you can also die. 

Verdict:

For the first entry in the series, The Mystery of the Mummy is a rather bland start. It's aged pretty poorly and it's just not really fun to play. The technical issues alone might be a gate not many might want to pass so I'd just recommend to skip to the next game in the series as it's much better.

Final Rating:
2.5/10

Pros:
+ Story is overall very intriguing

Cons:
- Getting this thing to run is a hefty task
- Many puzzles have obnoxious design which takes forever to solve 
- Graphics aged pretty poorly

Very Holme-esque story and style.  Interesting story is what kept me going in the game.

Cumbersome to go through all the clues to try and get the quiz questions right; some of them were not clear at all.  Moving Holmes is not easy, and a few times (getting through forest quickly and avoiding people) was really annoying and probaby would have been better to not be included.


Overall:

I would suggest playing this game ONLY on several conditions:  that you know it's an older game and that you probably will need to look up some things (maybe a lot of things) to progress without being too frustrated.

Honestly, the story was what kept me interested and wanting to finish the game.  The crime and the slow reveal of how it's done, along with playing/watching Holmes and Watson interact and investigate, were the best parts of the game.  That puts it above a 5 out of 10, but just barely.",True,1

Story:

You're put in the shoes of the titular detective Sherlock Holmes. You're tasked with solving the case of a murder of a young painter that was found wrapped in an expensive Persian carpet, but when you start digging into his past you find that he's had quite a few enemies.

There's actually not much of a story here. The game is level based and every level you go to a location look for items, solve a couple puzzles and then Sherlock barely updates on the case. It's not a very interesting story whatsoever and by the end I had completely forget who many of the suspects were and how they played into the story. It's just all very generic and uninteresting. 

Graphics:

The Mystery of the Persian Carpet looks pretty decent, however there's a big problem, basically everything is taken from older Sherlock games, especially Silver Earing. Environments are basically directly ripped and just have a bunch of items scattered around to make it look new, but in reality it's not.

Also there's a big problem with how the items are placed around the map. They just blend into the backgrounds as everything is so blurry and most of the items you need to find are like small shoe prints that blend into the environment are impossible to spot, but more on that later.

Audio: 

The music is also pretty decent, however yet again it's all re-used from the other games. It's the same music you already heard and it loops constantly and it got really irritating when solving the puzzles. In the other games it felt like the loop was natural and you were invested into the puzzles so it wouldn't be as noticeable, but here it feels shorter and it got annoying really fast.

Apart from the music, there's no other sound effects, there's like SFX taken from the other games too, but otherwise it's dead quiet. Not even voice acting which is sorely missing and I think it would have slightly improved the experience hearing Sherlock and Watson speak. 

Gameplay:

As I stated before the game is a bit of a departure from the other Sherlock Holmes games as this is a hidden object game, however unlike the others where there's a bunch of stuff cramped on screen, the game goes for a slightly different approach as in items actually spread around and in natural positions. 

This was by far the most annoying HOG game I have ever played in my entire life. I decided to play on the normal difficulty which allowed me to skip three big puzzles and each level gave me 5 hints to find items and trust me, if you decide to play this game, just put it on easy and get the maximum amount of hints, cause you will need them.
 
Like I mentioned before, the items are tiny, dark and sometimes the combination of the two. They blend in the environments so perfectly that I sometimes completely skipped over them and didn't notice them. I resorted to the standard HOG technique of just mashing the button all over the screen to pick it up, but the game has a trick up it's sleeve to force you to solve puzzles to get some items.

These puzzles are absolutely the worst part of the game. There are some good ones, but guess what they are literally ripped out of the other games. There's a puzzle where you have to fix a net which is ripped almost unchanged out of Nemesis and a card puzzle that's ripped out of Silver Earing, which is hilarious. 

But the icing on the cake is the luck based puzzles. One of the puzzles is a box which requires you to guess a number combination lock in five tries or the code resets and it's not a simple 5 number combination, YOU HAVE TO GUESS TEN FUCKING NUMBERS, IN FIVE TRIES and better yet there's another puzzle where you have to fight an annoying AI creating boxes. That's doable, but just so unfun it's just better to skip it. 

Verdict:

I know Sherlock Holmes: The Mystery of the Persian Carpet is a smaller budget title, but it's just so tedious and boring and just horrible to play that I can't even excuse it because it falls under the HOG genre. This is not worth the money full price or on sale, so skip to the other games in the series. 

Final Rating:
3/10

Pros:
+ There's a few fun puzzles 

Cons:
- However most of them are absurdly annoying and tedious
- Story is bland and forgettable 
- 99% of the game is things ripped out of the other games

11180,"The Good:

At times, it could be a fun hidden object game with decent puzzles.


The OK:

The story, I guess.  The plot and overall case was fine, as long as you realize this is an older game, with a simpler story line following a hidden object search.  If you're ok with that, it was decent enough.


The Bad:

As many other reviews said, some of the hidden objects were really nonsensical to find, and a few of the puzzles I simply had to look up online.  The worst one was finding the ten numbers, which is just a lucky guess and was a real pain to do.  The overall mechanics of game play were way more convoluted than they should have been.


Summary:

If you know what you're getting into (which I did from reading reviews beforehand, and knowing the older Holmes' games are simpler find and search ones), the game isn't that bad.  ""Isn't that bad"" does not mean it's good, though!  And again, this is knowing what I was getting into.  I realized beforehand there were going to be some bad puzzles and hard hidden objects to find.  But, it still was a much less enjoyable time than other Holmes games.  Finishing the game was a feeling of ""Ok, that's done"", rather than ""Wow, what a great experience"", and hence why I cannot recommend this game.

11190,"Hunt for the most prolific serial killer begins.

Story:

Set after the events of Sherlock Holmes Nemesis (sort of), you again play as the titular sleuth. The poor district of Whitechapel has been plagued by a serial killer that has brutally murdered multiple prostitutes in increasingly brutal ways and it's up to you to stop him at all costs. 

After the slightly mediocre storyline of Nemesis, Jack The Ripper picks up the slack and delivers on the thrills and chills that was so well crafted in The Awakened. The story is an intriguing and gritty detective story and the writing really helps to elevate the story. It actually genuinely gripped me and made me want to keep going until I reached the end. The writers and the developers also did a lot of research on the matter and it's actually fairly accurate to the actual events of Jack The Ripper down to really small details which is a great plus. 

There are a few moments where the writing quality takes a dip, especially in the final chapters of the games. I think it mostly falls under the wonky voice acting, but even then the majority of the writing is really good and probably the best we've seen by this point.

Graphics:

Visually the style is pretty much identical to The Awakened and Nemesis. There's a lot of stuff re-used from the previous games although there are a few things that are entirely new. One of the biggest problems introduced in Nemesis is large and barren environments which is sort of fixed in Jack the Ripper. 

You primarily go between two locations, Baker Street and Whitechapel. Whitechapel is a pretty big location with plenty of points of interest and it's actually really fun to explore. It's rundown dump and it looks ugly, but there's also people walking around, homeless people begging on the street or just sleeping on the corners. Just like the other games in this trilogy, it definitely didn't stand the test of time regarding the graphics, but it's definitely the best looking out of the three. 

Audio:

I want to begin with voice acting as this is what a lot of people that played these games talk about. I always really liked the voice actors for Holmes and Watson. They're decent and deliver their lines quite well with a few exceptions where a few lines fall flat. As far as the other actors are concerned, they're also decent enough with a few standouts, but again there's tons of characters that really ham up the accents. 

There's a few re-used music tracks and quite a few new ones. Each area has it's own unique music and I especially liked the music that plays when you explore Whitechapel. It's eerie and really adds to the ambience of the location, especially when you explore it through the night and even during the day. There's tons of re-used sound effects, but mostly it's decent enough so I'll give it a pass. 

Gameplay:

Sherlock Holmes versus Jack the Ripper is styled after The Awakened and Nemesis as everything is pretty much identical, however there's some new gameplay mechanics added to make the experience feel slightly fresher. While the other games by this point felt a lot more point and click-y, this time around the game is focused much more on the detective aspect. 

You're mostly going to be going around talking to witnesses or people of interest and getting some details which will help you with your investigations. There's still item collection to solve puzzles, but they're a lot more streamlined this time around because of a few different quality of life improvements the other games did not have.

Since the environments are just as massive as the previous two titles in the trilogy, you can now press space which will light up all points of interest. It won't light up where you need to go or what to do as that will be left for you to figure out, but you won't have to wander around looking for items or locations. 

You also have a lot of detective stuff to do, like creating timeline of events for each of the victims, deduce what happened on crime scenes and comb over testimonies to give you an idea of what to look for. For the first time it actually feels like you're doing detective work, instead of a point and click Sherlock themed game. 

As for the puzzles, well they range from absurdly easy to kind of annoying. There's a few puzzles where there isn't enough of instructions of what you're actually supposed to do and it sort of makes you feel like you're doing something wrong. However there's not that many of these type of puzzles and the majority of the puzzles are actually fun to solve. 

The biggest negative is again the absurd amount of backtracking. It's nowhere near as bad as it was in Nemesis, but the game boils down to tagging between a few locations as you solve puzzles. There's fast travel which helps, but I actually preferred walking around instead of teleporting around. Also again, I recommend playing it in FPS mode as the point and click mode feels like it would be a pain.

Verdict:

After a slight stepdown that was Nemesis, Sherlock Holmes versus Jack the Ripper picks up the slack and brings the goods. A great and accurate story of jack the Ripper and actually leaning onto detective gameplay makes this a blast to play, but it's definitely not without it's issues, but they can be easily overlooked. 

Final Rating:
7.5/10

Pros:
+ Story is a gripping and accurate take on the Jack the Ripper tale

11240,"Space Trader Merchant Marine is that strange situation where two very different genres have been combined together in the hope of hitting that once in a lifetime combination that everybody agrees is pure genius, like Vampires and Teenagers, or Ninjas and Cheerleaders. Space Trader doesn't quite hit that special recipe however.

Space Trader is a combination of a numbers trading simulator and a first person shooter and by far and large the biggest problem is that playing the game you have trouble telling which of these two aspects feel the most tacked on.

The trading part of the game is simple enough. You travel between various planets in the solar system, each planet has a a few merchants each selling a few goods. You buy as much as your bank account and cargo space will allow and then travel to the next world. Space Trader has no real in game economy however and everything is decided by the almighty Random Number Generator. The challenge of choosing which products to buy is virtually non-existent as all items for sale lists how below normal market value they are next to their name. There is also a legal/non-legal system in place however it has no real effect in game making the actual buying and selling of products extremely dull and predictable.

You explore the various locations on foot, in a first person shooter aspect. The various trade hubs allow you run around a small area, collecting various sellable items littered about the place, trade with the local merchants and take on a number of missions. The missions mostly come down to ""Bring X items"", ""Transport X items"" or, the more common, shooter mission. The majority of the missions in the game, and perhaps one of the easiest ways to make money early on in the campaigns is the various bounty missions which are your basic FPS. You spawn in one of a few predetermined maps, kill a few henchmen and eventually a boss will spawn. All the while you can pick up loot that you can sell out in the proper game, and weapons, health and shields that'll help you on this mission only. The shooting is fairly poorly implemented, even for it's time. The weapons feel like pellet guns, the enemy AI is non-existent and the whole experience usually boils down to just sniping at enemies from around a corner.

The music throughout the game is a high speed techno beat that, while I am sure some of you will love it, made me play with the sound off after a few sessions. There is no voice-acting and very little ambiance. Even gun shots and hit sounds leave much to be desired. Graphically the game is nothing to write home about but not much below what you would expect from an indie title either.

All in all, Space Trader Merchant Marine is a game that tries to do two things and fails at doing either in an acceptable fashion. It's not a very good trading simulation and not a very good shooter. It doesn't sound or look very good and it doesn't feel very good. This is a game that can easily be skipped.",False,33

11250,"Remember the heady days of SSI's venerable [b]""Great Naval Battles""[/b] (""GNB"") series, from ""GNB 2"" on (the original ""GNB"" was a Microprose title focusing on the North Atlantic)? 

Well, ""Great Naval Battles"", a series that was loved by players, and undermined by critics, has finally reared its' head above the dust and waters in this game. Specifically, ""GNB 2"" which focused on the naval battles and activities centred on Guadalcanal, though this title encompasses the entire Pacific, not just that small region to the north of Papua New Guinea.

""GNB 3"" expanded to include operations in and around Guadalcanal including carriers. Sure, the ships were 2D digitized representations, taking up only a fraction of the screen and you could only observe carrier operations (black sprites buzzing around the 2D ship) but they were so involving that hours would pass without notice. You became so involved in re-supplying the Marines and engaging Japanese supply columns and fleets that the poor graphics went by unnoticed. Then came Microprose's ""Task Force 1942"" and its' sequel ""1942:Pacfic Air War"" which both immersed you in the same campaign(s) but with beautiful graphics (the Battle of Savo Island at night with searchlights, tracer and fiery explosions was a sight to behold) that kept the player hooked. 

There were downsides (taking over a gun-station to fire at enemy ships was dodgy) but no one really complained. Dynamix had by then also entered the fray with ""Aces of the Pacific"" (""AotP"")and the world was yours. 

So, to [b]""Pacfic Storm""[/b] (""PS""). For me it has brought back those days of the ""GNB"" series and ""1942"". ""AotP"" would be better left in comparison with ""Pacific Fighters"" so I'll leave that there. What ""PS"" has done is re-kindle the fires of the previously mentioned games, expanded the Area of Operations, or AO to include the whole Pacific War and then thrown in a whopping dollup of ""Hearts of Iron"". Not content, they've added the arcade side to things by bringing in elements of ""Blazing Angels"". And they've done incredibly well. It was an ambitious notion to begin with and, according to most critics failed by doing so, but taken in context of past games it comes out gleaming. If you think the AI is dumb and useless, try ""1942"" where your US and Australian ships zigged and zagged all over the place seemingly oblivious the pounding they were getting. Thing is, that's what HAPPENED. Read any book on Iron Bottom Sound (the straits of Guadalcanal) and you'll be amazed at the naval carnage that occurred there. The Marianas Turkey Shoot, Okinawa, Sunda Straight...the list goes on. At the heart of the game (no pun intended) is ""Hearts of Iron"" and ""Axis and Allies"" to busy the player with the sheer magnitude of running this AO. It's deeply involving and not meant for a ""quick-fix"" session. They've included the Tactical engagements for that, and the Arcade elements are just a delicious cream on top. Sure it has bugs. All games do. Look at ""Joint Task Force"" which requires a whopping 200MB patch to make it playable from the get-go. 

Modders are already hard at work on this title and the Expansion Pack ""PS:Allies"" is said to fill in the gaps that critics have pointed out. The graphics are absolutely acceptable for a title of this magnitude, and don't even pretend to be Oleg Maddox. The intensity of a firefight between 2 opposing fleets is well portrayed and deeply engaging (pun intended). This is a game that will take effort and persistence to fully understand and implement. With the expansion coming to ""fill in the blanks"", I have high hopes for this title. And being half the price of most recent releases, I'd say you're getting a bargain. Just beware, this is not ""Blazing Angels"", so if you are looking for an easier game to master and play quickly look elsewhere. I thought the many hours I spent with the ""GNB"" series were just fond memories (not for my ""computer- widow-wife"", though). 

Now there is a new kid on the block. And this one is loaded for bear!

11250,"Well, i got this game for what would be half a dollar, and i gotta say im very shocked that a game like this was even made. In its surface its a very interesting 3D space WW2 pacific war RTS, then i find out you also have a rather shitty but still improvised flight simulator and unit control on every vehicle, then unit customization based on timeline and R&D, THEN that most of the game takes place in a 4x-esque pacific map where you have to micro manage you sending ships, making bases, logistic routes, training soldiers, and invasion/defense from the enemy. The entire game is absolutely jaw dropping in how much it tries to do at the same time...

And it fails at many of that. However not because the game is mediocre in itself, its not too bad, but the interface is absolutely horrid and takes a long while to get used to it, specially because it is outdated by 14 years almost, and it shows.

The AI that is VERY important in any campaing game since you do NOT want to micro manage every single logistic ship you use because then you would be running the game at 1:1 time scale from the real war. loves to forget to do the logistics,  or to return to base, or to do something. It gets quite annoying. Also sometimes my fleets dissappear but idk if that's just me not knowing what's going on because half the game is... in german. Yeah i heard in the forums you gotta translate it to spanish first, then delete some files, then re-translate to english to fix it, not to mention the game sometimes run like crap and likes to crash, its a technical nightmare that looks almost like if its maintained by a monkey. But there IS some love and detail put into it.

As i said, the AI is kinda fucky, and the interface is old, but the level of detail in the game, with how much you have to do, nand how much you can veer off the path of the war is absolutely interesting and nice to experience. Even after giving up with the game and how much it confused me, im still shocked to find out a game that can do so many scopes of a war at the same time.

Now, you wont be running into a 1950's pacific war with angled deck carriers, F9F cougars with Sidewinders AIM9B (although that would be the coolest shit ever), but you can artifically extend the war until USA and japan go well into jet age. Several systems are modeled, and every single plane has a 3D interior cockpit. One thing i really wish i could see more would be more types of vehicles, albeit this could just be a technical limit of the time, but for a game that lets you have B29s and P80s later on, but no bearcats, tigercats, or early navy jets, its quite a shame.

Another very interesting detail to mention, if you care, is that the game isn't entirely assymmetrical. Japan and US win conditions are SLIGHTLY different, in the campaign map. Requiring one to securely invade 2 out of the 3 naval port cities of the other, and in japan's case, 1 and then panama.

During one of my attempts at playing the game, one of my transport vessels ran out of fuel in the middle of the waters, and as far as i knew, it was permanently stuck there. There was no way to tow it or do naval refueling, and considering its not too hard to run out of fuel with the ships, and nothing stops you from doing so, i think this could be a rather important issue.

Overall: This game is amazing. But dont play it. Why? Because its got a sequel (Pacific Storm: Allies) and a fanmade mod for it called Pacific Fury that both improve a lot more what this game does. Its still great to know this exist and if you are into inferior prequels for the sake of knowing what people did, buy this. But if you are looking to deal through several issues to get a weird cool experience, there are improvements out there, but not here.",False,6

From Oil to fuel your ships and planes to the smallest MG-Bullet. You can set everything on auto-management for everybase, but then you only see dozen of ships drivin around, slowing down the game.

And since you never know what exactly they do, you never know if everything is done right.

This is de-activable in a so called ""Arcademode"", which supposedly makes it more like TW, you build the mine, it digs so much per month and at the end of the month you have the iron aviable without all this transport hysteria but then their´s still the battles...

They are the most important part of this game and would have a lot of depth but they are soooooooooooooo sloooooooooooooooow.

Wanna attack a port? Steer your fleet towards it for ten minutes. You can accelerate and slow down the time, which is helpful, especially since the game drops down to 5fps if you accelerate so high that your units would actually go faster.

While the puzzle genre is full of mediocre puzzle games, Obulis is one that is worth playing. The physics behind the game are great and some of the puzzles are truly devilish. As with any puzzler, there isn't much re-playability since once you know how to do a puzzle, well, you know how to do that puzzle.",True,48
11330,"[b]This is a long review so if you just want a summary of why I recommend this game skip to [u]Results[/u] and read from there.[/b]

IonFX makes a fun little puzzle game that produces a special world that combines Newtons three laws with gravity pushing your puzzle solving to the test. With sweet music and pleasant level design Obulis offers a deceivingly peaceful play through. 

[b]Gameplay:[/b]
After nine fearless hours I have completed Obulis. Obulis is an interesting game, but surely isn’t for everyone. In the category of puzzle games Obulis tests you by using a version of physics without friction to propel, roll, jump, shoot, catapult, and bounce spheres into containers. The levels vary and there are about 152 levels. The level difficulties go from Simple to Master with everything in-between. There is no difficulty setting for the campaign so in a single play-through you will play through a various difficulty settings, which pushes you through a rather smooth difficulty curve. Each section of Obulis has an ULTRA level which unlock after completing challenges throughout the “entire” campaign. These levels push you to the test and completing them unlocks achievements.  

[b]Features:[/b]
One of my favorite aspects of Obulis is that there is no rating for the puzzles. You either solve a puzzle or fail a puzzle, there is no score. I like this concept, but it essentially means there is no replay value to Obulis as there is nothing to do after you complete the game.  The puzzles keep you on your toes, and the slowly getting more difficult challenges keep pushing you to new levels. As you progress through the chapters of the game the not only are the levels changing, but they introduce new concepts: cannons, catapults, ballista, trebuchet, gears, horizontal moving floors, vertical moving floors, and more. These concepts differentiate the puzzles and make each of the levels seem unique rather than repetitive. 

[b]Game Issues:[/b]
I write a lot about this, but if you love puzzles and like precise timing you will probably get past this quiet easily. My major gripe about this game is that the puzzles are really more based on precise timing rather than finding a solution. You may find the solution on your first attempt, but because you have to time each click perfectly you’ll be sitting there for hours. When I was playing Obulis there were actually times where I went online to look at guides to see if I was solving the puzzle correct only to find out I was, but my clicks were not timed exactly perfect. On some puzzles it gets to the point where it stops being a puzzle game and it becomes more like “Sports Arena” the arcade game made by Sammy USA Corporation where there are lights circling the border and to win prizes you must push a button right as the light next to the prize goes on. If you have never heard of this Arcade Machine you may be able to assume that it’s essentially impossible to win because of how difficult it is to time when to push the button. Obulis presents similar annoyances as “Sports Arena”. Essentially you are just sitting there clicking a button at slightly different times to solve a puzzle you figured out the answer too quite some time ago. One of the other annoyances was that Obulis didn’t always give the same result to the same physical interaction. Sometimes the ball would move slightly differently even though the same exact event was occurring. This “glitch” sometimes resulted in me having to restart even when all the clicks were correct. Luckily if you are worrying during gameplay about whether you solved a puzzle correct and are just timing the clicks wrong there is a way to ease the pain. Go on YouTube and all the puzzles have been solved and made into videos, this can allow you to view if you’re making the mistake or not.

[b]Results:[/b]
The tedious timing issues and the minor glitches in the physics engine didn’t take away from Obulis; Obulis is actually a good play through. It offers about seven hours of puzzle solving (about two of the hours I played was with the game on pause while I was out doing other things). I recommend this game if you can get it in the Indie Puzzle Pack for a discount. I would not recommend paying full price for this game as it is essentially something you’d be able to find free elsewhere. 

Pros:
+Over 152 different puzzles
+Fun simple puzzles with nice serene music
+Comes in the Indie Puzzle Pack with a few other games
+Puzzles of varying difficulty, not all puzzles have to be solved to complete the game (some of the hardest puzzles can be skipped)
+Very easy controls, only requires a mouse
+Puzzles vary, add new challenges, and increase in variation as you get further in the game. 

Cons:
-All the achievements are for completing the Ultra Puzzles
-The game has some flaws in the physics engine
-Most of the puzzles have obvious solutions but require tedious work to correctly time to collisions",True,32
11330,"I've played some other puzzle games with a ""cut the rope"" mechanic, enjoyed them a lot, but compared to them, this one is annoying. 

The first annoyance is the highlight-left-click-right-click mechanic: why do I need a double click to execute a single, defined action? I can see how that might be an necessity so thick-fingered users on a small phone don't tap the wrong chain by accident, but on a tablet this is already unnecessary, and on a PC, where the mouse cursor highlights the chain to be cut, this is unforgivable.

The second annoyance is that these are not so much physical puzzles as timing puzzles: you can usually figure out the mechanics quickly, but the timing is so unforgiving that it usually takes several tries to implement a solution that you have already figured out.

Add to this the observation that ball behaviour seems to depend on the color of the balls -- I put a small grey ball in a resting spot and hit it and I can hit it to a place 4 times out of 5, and I put a small colored ball in the same spot and never get it there.

11330,"A few days ago, I crafted a Steam badge. In the resulting level-up, I was rewarded with a 90% off coupon for a game called Obulis. Checking the store page, I figured the game looked interesting enough, and because the coupon cut the total price down to a meager €0.50, I saw no pain in buying it, especially with all the other games I bought and have yet to even touch. It's a purchase I do not regret.

If you like puzzles, there's no reason why you shouldn't pass this game up. Even at its full price, it's fairly reasonable. Perhaps my only big gripes with this game are the occasionally obstructive foregrounds (such as in the Windmill area in Chapter 1) and the over-reliance on perfect timing rather than logic. Far too many times did I have to reset the level because I cut the chain/rope/pole a split-second too early or too late, making the marble in question completely miss its mark. This is especially bad in levels that require a lot of steps to complete. It's frustrating in that you can't solve the level despite knowing the solution.

But aside from that, everything else about the game is highly addicting and I strongly recommend that you try it if you're a fan of puzzle games.

The levels are generally easy. You have to link the same colored bubbles to chains, as longer as better. Sometimes there are pretty inventive modes like calculation numbers inside the bubbles to a balance or to deny downfalling bubbles to block a tube by upchaining and eliminate them.

- No learning curve at all: Just 'link' the bubbles.
- Creative: The levels are quite different from each other, except for 2 almost identical levels where one is required to 'link' a certain number of bubbles (only this 'number' changes).

Cons:
- The game itself is not relaxing at all!
- More often than not, there is a countdown timer, making one either rush or fail.
- Too much depends on luck, and not on one's play style -- especially on higher difficulties.

- Each level unlocks the next.

11360,"Good concept, but you can't ""beat"" it - you can only hope that it gives you the right bubbles in the right order, and that you're fast enough to notice that order and make the right chain. It sounds kind of exciting that way, but in reality, some of the levels are just too difficult because of the random allocation of colours. 

It's a puzzle game that you can't solve; a supposedly calm and relaxing game that often comes down to your twitch-reflex and your ability to spot when the game hands you the solution after hours and hours of combinations that make it literally impossible to pass the levels. And when you get stuck on a certain level that you know how to beat *in theory* but can't actually beat because the game keeps sending down purple bubbles into the middle of the yellow-bubble chain you've been building... it's just not fun.

The music is ok, and that's about the best thing I have to say for Chains. The level ideas are cool but poorly executed; so much so that a cool concept becomes abject torture... the graphics are quirky and somewhat artful the first time around, but after thirty attempts at the same level it loses any of interest from trying to figure out the ""flow"" and you're left staring at something that looks like childrens' scribble... and even when you do manage to pass an impossible level on a lucky run, it's only a matter of 1-2 more levels before you're stuck again and don't come back to play for months at a time...

seriously, the only reason I'm writing this review now is because I came back to Chains again because I had nothing else to do, and realised that this game held no interest whatsoever for me.

The puzzles themselves are pretty simple, but in addition to the old pixel hunt style, the game doesn't enable the hotspots for items or usable scenery until specific times.    Then, just to ramp up the frustration, there are timed puzzles, with the same constraints.   Suddenly scenery and items become arbitrarily active or inactive, with little time to experiment and search.   Feels like a serving of frustration with a side of screw you from the author.   Having a walkthrough helps, but it'll just piss you off when you see that your solution was correct -- you just weren't doing it the way the designer wanted you to, and at the right time that the designer wanted you to.",False,159
11370,"This game is based on a graphic novel, or a series of 3 graphic novels that later got compiled into one book called ""The Nikopol Trilogy""  written and illiustrated by a great French author named Enki Bilal. The art in the novel is what stands out the most and is a very dark, gritty,  and , industrial, steam-punk(architectural not the lame club scene), and is set in an alternate dystopian future where religions are now all powerful government parties and the ancient Egyptian gods themselves have returned to earth from space in a hovering pyramid spaceship. Despite being gods, with powers seemingly limited only by the imagination, they are still quite flawed sentient beings, who aregue and bicker and play board games to pass the time. They also require fossil fuels to power their spaceship and are stuck hovering over Paris. That is a basic run down of the story line for all you haters out there who ""don't get the story line."" 
        Secondly, there is also a pretty popular Sci-Fi film based on the Nikopol story called ""Immortal"" that came out in 2004. I remember watching it on the Sci-Fi channel a couple times and you can currently watch the full movie on YouTube. I highly recommend it. The movie was directed by the author of the graphic novel Enki Bilal and is actually quite a ground breaking movie in its own right. It revolutionized the art of mixing computer animation with live action. In this dystopian future there is heavy polution, and many people have become sick and prosthetic artificial body parts are not only required for most people, but it is a huge fad like plastic surgery gone haywire, and has become all the rage. So you see these real actors with computer generated parts and they had to film every scene twice exactly the same way. There are also aliens, who are ironically enough, treated just like illegal aliens and have to go through customs and immigration lol. 
      OK, so , on to the game. This was the first ""point and click adventure"" game I've ever really played, so it took some getting used to. The fact that this game is pretty closley based on the book and not the movie kept me pretty interested the whole time as it is stuff that happens to Nikopol inbetween the books. Yes the game is hard as hell and I did need a walkthrough on certain puzzles, but honestly, in a world where half the modern games are designed so  that a baboon could beat it on hard, it was a welcomed challenge. If you are used to point and click than you know what to expect. This game actually got me into more point and click adventure games such as Myst and a few others. If you are a fan of the movie Immortal(ad vitam) or the Nikopol Trilogy books than this game will blow your shorts off. If not and you kinda liked the crazy dark sci fi storyline, I highly recommend you check out all three.",True,67
11370,"Well, [i]Nikopol: Secrets of the Immortals[/i] is a short adventure game based on [i]The Carnival of Immortals[/i] - or [i]La Foire aux immortels[/i], the first book of Enki Bilal's Nikopol Trilogy, a series of graphics novels that illustrates 2023 Paris as an incredibly dark political dystopia with science fiction elements. Aside Enki Bilal's genius in depicting the surreal and the grotesque in Nikopol series, this game is a heavily watered down version of the first book, from Nikopol Jr.'s perspective.

It's year 2023. After two nuclear wars, countless political confrontations and casual genetic mutations, the world has become disease-ridden and post-apocalyptic. We take the silent, oblivious artist Nikopol Jr.'s perspective as puppeteered elections for the nation of Paris approaches. He is a silent romantic in a degenerate era. With the appearance of an odd spaceship in the form of an Egyptian pyramid on Paris astroport, Alcide Nikopol's life is about to change drastically.

Before continuing with my review, I have to warn you: if you are to only play this game, without reading comics first, I suspect that you would be capable of understanding anything. As a stand-alone game, story presentation is mismatched and rushed. It is more than likely to complete the whole game without understanding anything about the affairs going around. The setting is not well-presented enough to capture the grotesque genius of the series and a great amount of characters, events, explanations are completely skipped in this bland interpretation. So if you've found the concept to your liking and got curious, drop the game and get yourself Nikopol Trilogy to enjoy an A+ quality creepy dystopia.

Okay, now we've established the quality difference between graphic novels and the game, I'll focus on the game. Graphics might be considered beautiful in their own displays, and character animations are quite elegant. I especially liked the character designs for Egyptian characters - Horus and Anubis. Voice acting isn't marvelous, and the subtitles being nonexistent doesn't stand in the favor of the game either though.

Well, when we talk about the gameplay, [i]Nikopol[/i] has its list of downsides. Without the usage of a walkthrough, it is possible to miss an item and keep playing only to find that you cannot progress anymore due to the item not being available for you to grab anymore. On that department, I suggest saving a lot - which is another issue, with only 10 save slots given. Also, you are capable of dying in a handful of imaginative ways, considering that you are treated as a terrorist by the government from the start of your game. In that sense, no, this is not your casual point and click adventure. Puzzles are usually interesting and imaginative, and they demand prior attention to the storyline, so you have to keep certain facts at mind before trying to handle a puzzle. With the slightest mistake, you are prone to alarming security and getting shot down. Luckily, game restores your position before being shut down every time.

As an adventure game, [i]Nikopol: Secrets of the Immortals[/i] isn't anything unique or even interesting, with its grander equivalents around. As an Enki Bilal interpretation, it could present you a brief smile if you are already familiar with his work. If not, go fetch the comic book. Only after reading the original work, if you could say that you are still curious, yeah, go ahead. Otherwise, the game won't mean anything to you.

11370,"Nikopol has never had a very good reputation on Steam, stretching all the way back to its launch. I've always been curious about it, what with its futuristic stylings and rad floating pyramid. Honestly, starting it up it felt no worse than a lot of indie adventures, and the sharp pre-rendered backgrounds and interesting setting did a lot to get me in the mood for some weirdness. But the weirdness was quickly drowned out by some unexpected pixel hunts, some aggravatingly complex puzzles, and a general lack of polish and important details.

Based on the works of a French graphic novelist (whom I am definitely going to check out now), Nikopol is the story of a guy named Nikopol, strangely enough. He lives in a dystopian Paris ruled by a theological dictatorship in the year 2023, which I just realized is a scant six years from now. Le Pen's Paris is a gray and decaying place, full of armored soldiers and what I can only assume are genetically-engineered creatures dedicated to enforcing their laws. Nikopol, an artist and member of the resistance, gets chased out of his apartment by one of these beasts and into the jaws of a conspiracy involving the church, his father, Egyptian gods, and... wait, what?

The moment Anubis himself meets you in a slummy urban graveyard is probably the moment that what weak grasp you have on the plot is lost. There's clearly a LOT going on here with the different shades of religion and many factions vying for power in the shadow of the enigmatic floating pyramid, and you're going to get approximately none of it here. Monsters and cyborgs and spirits will appear to give their little spiels and then vanish back to wherever the hell they came from, leaving you to toil through the puzzles and reach your goal with little rhyme or reason to guide you.

And those puzzles, Jesus Cyberchrist those puzzles. So in one scene, there's a vending machine holding funerary urns full of ashes and you need the one your mom is in. You need coins from an offering box next to you but the cyborg priest is using a wall-mounted mirror to make sure you don't dip into his tithes. The solution is to pick up a nearly-invisible rock from the ground, chuck it at the mirror to break it, and then use the coins to sort through the machine one urn at a time in search of your mom. This, of course, is used to set up a ritual room of stone plates and chalk drawings using ""A is next to B, B can't be across from C"" puzzle clues, and then later using that room to solve a secret message substitution code.

That's Nikopol in a nutshell, a mess of confusing and frustrating puzzles carrying along a hopelessly incomprehensible plot. So many of the items you need are nearly invisible both because they blend perfectly into the detailed scenes and because you won't even realize you need them in the first place. To clear the debris from one doorway you have to (a) pick up a brick from the debris, (b) clear a specific spot on the floor, (c) place the brick, (d) pick up and place a tall board to prop the ceiling, and then (e) use a hammer to knock away the rest of the debris. The only clue you're going to get to ANY of this is a line about the ceiling being unstable. And this is going to be every chapter, with the puzzles getting worse and worse.

It's a real shame too, because with a little more focus and polish and, um, story this could have been quite good. The static scenes you explore are well-detailed, a few of the puzzles early on aren't too terrible, the voice acting is... passable... Okay, maybe this one was doomed regardless but it still could have been better than this. At the very least they could have hired a real translator instead of transcribing dialogue with hilariously obvious misspellings. Really though that's just one more annoyance to add to a veritable mountain of troubles. Nikopol's reputation for being frustrating and incomprehensible precedes it for good reason, and it's bad enough that there's no chance I'll ever see its end.

11420,"I beat this game three times, but that's just me.

This game is surprisingly underrated despite being so original.

The good:

The lightening is great, almost on par with direct x 10.
The graphics are insanely well-rendered: the walls, the ground, the floor, the weapons, the sky, the faces of monsters and hominids, the overall bleak atmosphere makes you want to turn a jesus freak just to be slightly psychically alleviated from this non-stop 10 hour or so journey through the darkest pages of the Bible. In my opinion, they have perfectly shown the horrors of living forever and not ever being able to die, to make matters worse they show just how scary it is to contemplate being condemned to eternal existence in escape-proof physical and mental prison. So pay close attention to NPC's that you encounter in the game. I think they may have a some good philosophical tips to ponder about.

It is amazing how this game was able to bring the old archaic Bible fables to life and to the gruesome reality.

The game brings the new innovative way to play six characters at almost any point in the game. Each character has his and her own regular and mystical abilities. And you need to use each one to get through certain points in the game. Each character also has charisma, with the exception of the Albino maybe, but otherwise, the conversation between the characters isn't always cliche and it is guaranteed to put a smirk on your face once in a while.

I think the strongest point of the game is the actual story, the actual journey through time and alternate realities filled with dystopia and hopelessness. The funny thing is that, aside from seeing some footage of our reality for about 15 seconds at the beginning of the game, you don't really see any of our own world. Which only means that by the time you play half the game and get your fair share of scares and gruesome scenes and situations, you really start to wonder if the whole world is worth saving or if you really should give a damn about your own existence in this maze withing maze within maze of a journey, or whether the reality you left behind exists anymore. So your only way is going forward, and the odds are certainly against you. It's like watching Inception for the first time and trying to figure out where they are sleeping and if so, which level of dream they are in. The game has similar kind of feel to it.

There's a fair amount of interesting, non-frustrating bosses and mini-bosses, each with some good dialogues and some sort of a background that we all may have heard about.

The firefights are pretty good too, your friendly NPC's do a fair amount of shooting and killing themselves, although you will still remain the one with most kills. The enemy AI isn't so bad either. Many enemies rush at you yet they also evade your bullets, plus you can find yourself encircled pretty easily when some enemies pop out behind you. Plus you may suffer gravely if the kamikaze enemies approach you.

The ambient sound is stunning. There isn't a single thing they missed with the sound, they captured every little far away shriek sound and every sound produced by a drop of blood from ceilings.

The gore, there's plenty of it and it's damn good.

The game is pretty linear with the exception of having the option to concentrate on playing different characters for varied gameplay. BUT, and the scripted events and in-game footage cut scenes ARE informing and often bring unexpected results.

Each and single enemy has its own best way of getting killed. And each time you beat the game, you can concentrate on each of the six characters and try to play as that character the most. Of course I am not saying that all characters are equally balanced, but what's really balanced in life?

One of the best points for me in *minor spoiler"" is how the game has the minerals to kill off a couple of your characters in one sweep. This truly shows some unconventional line of thinking wherein there doesn't have to be a perfect happy ending for everyone, where is no outside force to come in and save the day where there's no soul salvation for those who died. Not only that, as you play the game, it slowly dawns upon you that the main character you played from the start (the one that actually teleports from one character to another to take control of them) has no happy ending no matter what. It's hard to explain, nor would I want to spoil anything, but you do get a feeling that your main character lives on overtly borrowed time. It's like someone from a zombie movie who managed to outlive the time when you turn into a walking dead long after he or she were bitten. So, it slowly dawns on you that as your hurl towards your final goal in the game, there may be no happy ending, but a utilitarian-kind of sacrifice. Not only may the thought not cause some pessimistic thoughts, but it may also ""test"" your inner self to make you ponder what you would do in a particular situation. I may be looking too deep into a game, but what the hell.

There's plenty of background info to unlock regarding your friendly NPC's, enemies, bosses, events and locations as you play the game. It's pretty rewarding since you don't know much about the characters or ftw is going on at the beginning for that matter.

The bad:

1) I don't like the whole concept of the automatic download of ammo. It's not really the ""infinite ammo"" concept per se, but it's something close to it.

2) There's no co-op mode. A co-op mode for this game would probably earn a solid 9.5 from me.

3) The game ends.

Anyways, this game gets a solid 9.0 from me.
I can only advise to beat this game in one sitting for complete immersion. Choose a good Saturday or Sunday, wake up at 12pm and try to finish the game by the end of the day to fully dip yourself in a great, and albeit, underrated journey through the hellish nightmare.",True,82
11420,"Jericho is a mishmash of genres and ideas brought together under the umbrella of a supernatural top-secret army unit commanded by a ghost. The second game to bear Barker's name, Jericho has no relation to Clive Barker's Undying, save for the demonic themes. Although a little difficult to describe, Jericho's plot centres around the aforementioned unit's mission to stop the apocalypse by battling through time and reality, and killing everything that moves.

While Jericho sounds a little generic, the contents are anything but. Featuring a team of six controllable characters, each of which with two special powers and most with several weapons that can have up to four modes each, Jericho provides even more firepower than some of the FPS classics. Although Jericho is a game of gimmicks, it's chief one is that you, the player, are the commander of this squad and can body-hop freely between any of the other members close by, using them as you see fit, while AI takes control of the other members, allowing you to take out enemies, solve puzzles and progress through levels as the 'player' while feeling like you're working as a team.

Somehow this review got noticed by people, so I'm going to actually go into some details. Which kind of kills the whole joke of this game being broken on such fundamental design levels that one sentence summed it all up, but whatever.

Do you like Serious Sam? I sure do. There's something about the enemy variety, the fast pace, the environments, and the weapons that all work together perfectly to make each encounter a thrilling experience that you actually want to push through. You're well aware that the entire game is this process of entering the next ""room"" and clearing whatever waves of enemies they have planned for you, but the design is such that it's a pleasant experience each time. I'm not even mentioning the secrets, which add that extra layer of exploration.


I've never heard this comparison before,  because it's kind of a terrible one, but Jericho desperately wants to be a horror themed Serious Sam. It also wants to be a military shooter, and it also wants to have squad control elements. Very few games suceed at hitting multiple marks, which is why good games generally focus on one thing, lest they spread themselves thin. Jericho not only fails to hit the mark on any of its attempted goals, it outright brushes its teeth with a gun in the morning.


Squad controls that are tacked on are never fun, and rarely add to a game, but here it's like they had characters from a bunch of cancelled games, and decided they HAD to use them somehow. At random times you'll just split up the bumblefuck AI, and there isn't really any noteworthy change to be noticed except that you no longer have the ability to possess whomever split apart from your group.

Oh, right. You can possess your squadmates. Spooky.

After the first few missions, you get the ability to inhabit the bodies of your squadmates, and each one has their own weapons, skill sets, and so forth. It's a geniunely neat idea, and one that Jericho, to its credit, doesn't completely mangle. The main issue here is that very few of the squadmates are any fun to play as, so when the guy with the bigass minigun goes off with the other fireteam for a bit, the options left for you to use aren't nearly as fun or compelling. Ninja ladies stopped being cool in early 2003, and every other enemy in this game explodes into a one-hit kill burst when they die.

If you, for whatever reason, persist and keep playing, the game has nothing to reward you for your efforts but more pain. Enemies will continue to spawn on top of you, instant death quick-time events can and will happen at least twice a mission, and you'll be left wishing you had just played Undying again.

For real, just play Undying again.",False,15
11420,"Imagine F.E.A.R in a cooler setting, with squad based magical and conventional warfare against the twisted denizens of Hell who have been trying to claim the Earth since God struck down the Firstborn. The game is extremely cheap and offers some of the best value on Steam outside of a sale, it is the most underrated game of this generation and then some. While it does lack some polish, and the A.I. (both friendly and not) can be abhorrently stupid, there is a unique experience here that I'd recommend to anyone with a pulse. 

Firstly, the A.I. despite it's occasional screw ups is also one of the best I've genuinly seen. Your squadmates move around fluidly as you progress through the levels, bolting from cover to cover like an XCOM game. They make full use of their magical abilities and are actually helpful when you're in trouble. Enemies on the other hand will usually pour out in single file begging to be shot, but sometimes they (possibly accidently) seem to spread out around your squad and attack from angles and effectively splice you and your team into bitesize chunks and totally overwhelm you. Enemy variety is both lacking and plentiful. Whilst their are tons of different cultists and demons, most of them behave and attack in the same manner and simply require a few more holy cantations and bullets to bring down than the others.

Gunplay is solid, the occult magical abilities that you and your squad use feel worthwhile and on high difficulties; neccesary. Each squad member is completely unique and carries their own strength & weakness. The initial character is durable, has a wicked assault rifle/shogun combination in one weapon (although more than a mere AR with an underbarrel shotgun). The others include a sleeky, fast moving assassin-type character with extremely powerful melee but low durabilty and a somewhat underwhelming firearm. There is the badass viking female sniper who has the highest single shot damage output of the lot and a ton of magical abilities, the quintessential 'heavy' with godly durability and a minigun, the priest archetype with a sleek leather combat robe, dual pistols and holy magic and much more.

Graphically the game is somewhat dated but despite being a console focused game, looks like a pure PC experience. For £3.49 or your regional equivilent it is very hard to go wrong with this game, just be warned that it will not work at all unless you install the Nvidia legacy mini-driver that fixes long dated PhysX 7 issues, even if you're running an ATI graphics card. The only real downside to the game is the lack of co-op and the fact that there is little to no chance of a sequel. This is all coming from the perspective of somebody who payed £25 to play the inferior version on the 360.

The combat seems stale at times, only serving to stall the story. But the story, being written by a Horror God, is fantastic. The dialogues between characters later on is believable and well spoken.

 [h1]Verdict[/h1]
I had this game as a child, saw the commericals and ads as a kid and thought it was super cool. In the end i got the game it it was really good. This was a couple of years ago. and by a couple, i mean about 9 or 10 years. Maelstrom is an RTS or Real Time Strategy game, a dying genre, which took a role nobody had thought of, post apocalypse. We had Starcraft with the space theme, Command and Conquer with the modern and futuristic, hell we even had starwars. But this was a spectacular idea, based around the same i believe Maelstrom was meant to compete with the likes of Command and Conquer and Starcraft alike. It features 3 factions each with their own unique playstyle, Remenants, or what remains of the military using scrap and salvaged vehicles and weapons to win. The Acension are a high tech ""corporation"" that specializes in technology and futuristic stuff. And finally, the aliens or, Hai-Genti. These are a race of aliens that function more or less as bioweapons and focus on flooding the world. The story seems really cool, only issue is its almost impossible to play. As of right now on steam, if you run the game theres a solid 50/50 chance that everytime a cutscene runs, your game will either proccede as it should, or crash entirely. And Maelstrom is almost like a movie, which wouldnt be bad..... if it didnt risk whole campaign missions. Theres also another cool feature of taking direct control of your factions hero units and fighting in that sense, however its almost pointless as its a cutscene to trigger it. So your game could crash making it a not-so-viable option. The Remenants are about the only straight-foward faction with what they need and how they aquire it. The Acension and Hai-Genti will require a bit of learning to successfully use. In my regards if the game was patched up a bit more than it is now, it would be playable and a classic. But the sole reason that the game is almost unplayable in general because of the bugs makes it a big no no. Maelstrom essentially was a really good concept, but was just barely undershot with its release.",False,8

I admittedly haven't played this a ton, but that's because it is so infuriating and pales in compairison with [b]Theme Hospital[/b].  I REALLY want an update of that game, but I thought I'd give this a go.  At first I thought it was almost exactly like Theme Hospital...but newer, but it quickly falls apart.  The story plays out like a hospital drama/comedy and the idea is solid, but it drags out and makes me want to poke the writer in the eye.  It's like watching your kid brother try to crack wise, but really it's just sad.  Very disappointing.
The diseases and equipment/trteatments are very much inspired by TH, and that's a good thing.  But my patience runs thin when staff aren't effeciently getting paients to their rooms.  It's even harder to deal with when I have to piddle around with ALL the buttons to figure out what I need to do to get things done.  It's hard to tell exactly what you need to do or fix to complete missions/levels.  Most of the time I passed without knowing what I'd fixed.

The main quest is always the shady person out of the cast of the characters asking you to fetch some god awful, powerful evil device for ""good"" and the pc shrugging and saying ""Why not? What harm could you possibly do with it, guy I just met yesterday?""

This game is easily one of the best puzzle games I've ever played. The captivating music and sound effects fit it's addictive nature very well. 
The only thing I don't like about this title is the lack of global leaderboards :(

11900,"This is the worst version of Lumines out there, but it's still worth getting if you've never played it before. That's how good the core game is.

Let me clarify; it's the worst version out there because it has the least amount of content, not many options to tweak, and worst of all doesn't support custom content. The PC version could have stood apart and allowed custom songs/themes and instead it recycles some of the most generic songs from previous entries. There's also no DLC, so although you get to save some money by not buying extra songs, you'd better hope what little is there will satisfy you.

Put in simpler terms, if you've played previous versions of Lumines, avoid this entry, because you've literally played/seen all that it has to offer. If you've never played it before, and PC is your only option, then sure, pick it up. It's a great color matching/block busting game with a unique clear-bar mechanic. The first 2 entries on PSP were known for having pretty good soundtracks. Every entry since then has gotten a little worse in my opinion regarding music.",True,8
11900,"The port isn't very good, but man, I loved this game back when it was first released on the PSP. The clean graphics, good music and addictive gameplay; it all made sense. The goal is to create cubes (by using cubes). The cubes that fall down have two colors so you have to match them and try to make as many cubes as possible before the 'beat line' moves over them. It's really a line that moves from the left to the right (apparently on the beat of the music, but I'm usually too focused to notice) and clears the cubes. Of course things speed up after a while until you are overwhelmed. It has a lot of similarities to Tetris actually (it's hard to create a game like this these days that doesn't use Tetris elements so I can live with it. Besides; Tetris rules !). Anyway, the game itself is definitely worth it, the port itself, however... not really. If you can get it cheap, do yourself a favor and get it immediately though.

11900,"An excellent PC port of one of my favorite puzzle games for the PSP, only hampered by the choice not to implement gamepad controls as an option. The modes are as entertaining and challenging as their original counterparts, and the music is an eclectic mix of some of the best Lumines & Lumines II skins. I highly recommend, if you don't already have it on PSP, Vita, or other Playstation consoles, that the PC port is a great way to go.",True,3
11900,"Played a bunch of this on PSP.

Solid game for people who haven't played it before, very fun and addictive puzzler, but once you've spent a week with it you don't really want to revisit it. Great to pick up on sale.",True,3
11900,"The prodigal son of Tetris, the PSP-born Lumines is pure, absolute awesome. The seemingly simplistic gameplay sucks you in after minutes of playing, and does NOT let go. You'll want to score higher, get huge combo bonuses, unlock skins, and generally play more of it :D",True,3
11920,"Loved to death that energetic japanese take on classic tetris formula (all three of those across PSP/Vita) – absolutely hated lousy work someone’s done with PC port (mainly because they screwed up the “clearing wall” timing for most of the tracks, so extra-kicks in the music mix for doing combos sounded out of sync with the main song)
It wasn’t game-breaking, but, being one of those rhythm games, where rhythm is mostly a cosmetic dressing, it was very annoying.

I would give away my arm and leg for having proper hi-def/60fps PC port of Vita’s Lumines Electronic Symphony with all the originally licensed tracks included, but that’s never going to happen.",False,7
11920,"Color coded blocks fall and chaining them together makes them disappear. What makes this game unique in the puzzle genre, though, is that the blocks don't simply disappear instantly - a white line sweeps over the entire field periodically, and as it passes over chained blocks it ""tags"" them for destruction. While it is doing so, you can add more blocks to that. They are destroyed once the white line reaches the end of the current chain. This is interesting because it allows you to extend your combos, adding a little more depth to the game. 

One of the key features of the game is that the blocks emit sounds in tune with the songs, and doing bigger combos changes the music. The bigger and faster you combo things, the more frantic the song gets. 

There a few game modes, like mission, puzzle, time attack and regular. Nothing you haven't seen before, so no need to explain.

Will you like it? I don't know, but you will certainly hate it if you dislike the soundtrack, so before buying it, try listening to the OST or looking some gameplay videos on youtube first. 

Is this a good port? Kind of. It seems like the assets were lifted straight from the PSP game and there is no option to make it fullscreen at all - you get black bars on top and on the bottom of the screen (maybe they wanted the CoD audience so they did this to make it more ""cinematic""...?). That aside, it behaves adequately. I do feel like the songs in the PSP version were better (unless my memory is deceiving me) and they could maybe add some filters, but at the end of the day you will be looking at a bunch of squares, so having anti aliasing or anything else is hardly a dealbreaker.

Also, do note that this game has never, ever been on sale. I think the developers forgot they even put it here. It seems kind of expensive for what it is, and I don't think the Advanced Pack is really worth it.",True,4

Vice City is still my favourite, perhaps due to nostalgia and perhaps due to the 1980s vibe being done so well, but this game is undeniably better. It really is Rockstar (North)'s masterpiece. A long story, varied game play, flying planes (while still frustrating at first) is done well enough that it can be a part of a whole bunch of story missions, memorable characters.

12140,"Max Payne is not just a game, it's a time capsule of memories that will transport you back to your childhood. For many of us, it was one of the first games that we played on our PCs, and it left a lasting impression that we still cherish to this day.

The gameplay is just as gripping as it was all those years ago. The shooting mechanics are smooth, and the bullet-time effect is still as satisfying as ever. The story is also one of the most memorable in gaming history. Max's journey from a detective seeking justice to a broken man seeking revenge is an emotional rollercoaster that will leave you on the edge of your seat.

But what really sets this game apart is the atmosphere. The gritty, neo-noir world of Max Payne is as immersive as it is haunting. The city is a character in and of itself, a place filled with danger and despair. The music is also top-notch, perfectly capturing the mood of each scene.

As you play through the game, you'll be hit with waves of nostalgia. You'll remember the times you got stuck on a particularly tough level, and the elation you felt when you finally made it through.

But you'll also feel a twinge of sadness. The memories of a simpler time, when we had nothing to worry about except getting to the next level, are bittersweet. Max Payne reminds us of a time when we were young and carefree, and it makes us long for those days again.

In conclusion, Max Payne is not just a game, it's a time machine that will take you back to a simpler time. It's a game that's filled with memories, both happy and sad. It's a game that will make you laugh, cry, and everything in between. So, if you haven't played it in a while, do yourself a favor and fire it up. Relive those memories, and remember a time when life was just a little bit easier. It's a solid 10/10 from me.",True,2

12310,"The best adventure since Blade Runner for me. You do not use your mouse to check every pixel for that one thing you miss. Instead you have to decide how to talk to people, what to mention, what to hide, how to proceed.
You don't have to find *the* right solution. You find *your* solution.
I got hooked by this one.",True,108
12310,"PUBLIC NOTICE (Uncut patch): I made an uncut patch for Steam (the original uncut version is no longer available for sale) which adds full subtitles, decensors the game and has bonuses, here:
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=697262043

My playtime is low even though I finished the game because I played using the uncut version executable.

Now the review:
Culpa Innata is a fantastic and quite unique adventure game, it does a lot of things most games don't and really deserves your time and money.

Many adventure games are set in criminal investigations but none succeed in actually making you feel like an official investigator going through actual interviews non-sequentially and piecing together the evidence like Culpa Innata. You have a limited amount of time - in the game that translates to the number of people you can interview based on travel time to location - and must choose wisely whom to interview, what to ask and which leads to follow up (and report) in the game's many locations. You also have a well developed private life after the day's investigations in which some other plot threads are explored. The game is non-linear and major reveals therefore happen in a way that is specific to how you chose to advance.

Another great success is the game world in which characters' scripts, motivations and way of life feel very lived-in and set in the new world order established by a subtly totalitarian regime very different from the one we live in. The main character herself sometimes says questionable things as she is an active part of the system up to a point. This does make you as the player explore this world on a deeper level than if you were controlling a detached completely-different-from-everyone protagonist meant to make you empathise with a corrupt society that cannot be accepted. The story is very interesting and while the game suitably ends the main plot there are some secret threads set up for a sequel that hopefully sees the light of day sometime.

For its age, the visuals are great and the facial animation is solid. Faces having an almost photorealistic feel at times due to the way it uses film grain without being excessive. The soundtrack is nice too, fits the mood well. The voice acting is also very good. I did not encounter any game-breaking bugs or crashes when playing the game (Note: I was using the uncut version patch shared on top of this review).

All in all, a fantastic adventure game I'm glad I played and highly recommend it to you all!",True,80
12310,"This is really a very unique adventure game, I play adventure games since the 80's and i am very amazed with this one. The game  is full of realistic dialogs and interesting characters. I am guessing over 15 hours of dialogs are in the game. Only downside is, the graphics are a bit low quality and pathing is confusing. I wish a sequel is made. 

I strongly advice this game to adventure gamers.",True,61
12310,"""The best adventure since Blade Runner for me."" Gotta agree with this guy. This game is amazing. Great story (based on a book, if I recall correctly), nice characters, interesting puzzles, multiple endings (based on our choices). World Union (where the game takes place) reminds me a lot of  Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. 

As for the graphics, for a game that old I don't even think they're bad. Just a warning: see those black bars on the screenshots? Game doesn't run in widescreen. But the story is so amazing that, believe me, you won't even remember that after playing it for 30 minutes

If you're a fan of adventure games and a good, solid sci-fi story, give this game a chance. I don't think you'll regret it

For those wondering about those merely 4.4 hour of gameplay on my profile, Steam version is cut (it lacks a few sex scenes, like Fahrenheit), so I grabbed the full version elsewhere, and that's the one I've been playing",True,58
12310,"Seems like it might be a good game. Looks good and seems interesting. Unfrotunately it is useless and unplayable for me. It says it has Captions, There is a captions option. But the major game breaking problem is the captions are only in the cut scenes. Given the point and click style of gameplay  and no in game captions makes this very difficult.  Click  somethign and the character tells you about it. Probelm is, I am a Deaf/HOH gamer..... So, like i said, rather than simply havign in-game captions, this game speaks to tell you what you need to know... Which is completely usless for me.
What a shame, looks like it could be a great game if it was playable..",False,18
12310,"This is a great first part of what should have been a series.

Culpa Innata is set in the near future in a society that most of us would find very alien. The main character is an officer given the task of investigating a murder which is an event so rare in this world that everyone doen't really know how to start.

The best thing about this game is the detail of the setting. 'The World Union' where the main character lives and works is a society different to any of our own. In the game you not only carry out your investigation but interact with friends and colleagues to get a proper feel of what being in such a society might be like. There's also a lot of reference to the countries not absorbed by this society and how things are different. The writers have done an excellent job of giving a richly detailed picture of this world.

The main negative point of this game is that it is part 1 of 2 but part 2 never got produced. The principal aim of the game (ie solve the murder) is resolved nicely but so many more interesting questions appear on the way but never get answered. Very frustrating.

Other important points:

Gameplay: The game is highly non-linear. There are day cycles and you can only fit a certain number of things into each day but other than that the choice is very free. This makes the game DIFFICULT, particularly if you can't find a trigger for an event.

Puzzles: A nice balance of dialogue/persuasion, logic puzzles and inventory use.

Visuals: The 3D environments are well rendered but nothing very special.

Voice Acting: Very good on the whole with a few terrible accents.

Music: A futuristic dystopian nightmare. I turned it down when I could.",True,17
12310,"At first glance it is just an ugly adventure game from some unknown Turkish developer. So why is it in my recomendation? Because of that world, which is presented. This isn't game for kids. In fact, it's really grim game full of politics and distopian visions and if you give it a chance, it can definitely surprise you...",True,16
12310,"I thought it would be interesting, but the ridiculous setting and conversations ruin it thoroughly. You are supposed to be solving a murder, but instead of investigating the crime scene, body, weapon, motive, etc. the main character goes around talking to everyone about their sex lives. She is also apparently only allowed to ask one or two questions per day of anyone she meets, and despite the case being confidential, she blabs about it to everyone within earshot. There is also a completely unexplained (and unconnected) subplot involving ""chaos"", which eventually leads to a meeting with a group of people living below ground that might as well be a bad trip for all the sense it makes. 

Wild perspective changes make it tough to get a sense of the true layout of each area, and some areas can only be found by walking to a specific unmarked location on the screen. And while the voice acting is no doubt intended to convey that in this enlightened future nobody ever raises his voice ever again, it makes the whole experience feel flat and uninvolved.",False,15
12310,"This is a pretty good futuristic adventure game.  While I did play it with a general walkthrough you could definitely finish it without one.  The thing I liked most about it is that unlike the old-school adventure games (King's Quest, Space Quest, etc.) you can't really bork your game by not picking something up that you will need 5 hours later.  Definitely one that I would recommend to adventure fans, and depending on your patience, a pretty good one for others as well.",True,15
12320,"The negative reviews are right, this game doesn't work on Windows 10. It freezes on the initial load screen, with the word 'fonts' on the loading bar.
I had to Ctrl+Shft+Esc and type 'sac' then Delete just to be able to go back to the desktop. It locks everything up otherwise.

DarkStar One is a space exploring TPS featuring a very advanced ship,a pretty large map with many events to find and do,a decent story but also a pretty good combat system.

Graphically,it looks pretty ok,some of the effects could be a bit better or polished and there are parts when the bloom is sort of overly saturated,but it's quite enjoyable flying around checking out different planets,space stations or some of the asteroids you can checkout. On a sidenote,all the different zones also have their own vibes and colors,so that's a nice touch to the general looks. 

Sound wise,it is pretty average,nothing really stands out or becomes jaw dropping or goose bump-inducing,but the voices are done quite well,localization and surround is decent,overall,not bad. 

Now as gameplay goes,here it gets interesting,cause the ship develops as you find some crystals that you spend after on developing either engines,hull or turrets,all of them with different benefits,luckily at the end of the game you can get all the upgrades,so you can choose whatever you like.
 
All the factions have their own weapon that has different levels or a rarer version you can find from missions or pirate captains,some are kinetic or energy based,some are explosive or barely do damage,but have different effects. Gadgets and ship abilities can be upgraded and unlocked as you progress,opening up more zones and different tactics,even getting to the point where you can take down cruisers all alone,but that is pretty late in-game.
 
Most stations have some random missions or you can just trade or be a pirate and shoot down police patrols or merchants,all of them turning you slowly into either an outlaw or a trader or just be a jack of all trades.
 
Now,some of the story missions are harder than they should be,especially the two station defense ones,where you control a turret. Those are way too hard,might even seem broken,especially the latter one,but besides that,it's pretty fun and balanced.
 
Didn't encounter too many bugs,very minor ones at least,where a drone was stuck so I booped it a bit with the ship and fixed it,a conversation stayed on,seemed neverending but again,hit his ship with mine and it was fixed,so nothing game-breaking from my experience. 

Overall,for the price it has,it's definitely worth a try,it is a good space exploring game,with some unique features and moments with nothing to really complain about.

12340,"A sprawling, humorous adventure in the old style, beset by enough problems that it's better to save yourself from the frustration and forget about it. Lots of pretty decent voice acting, even if it's all hammy and silly, but few of the belly laughs of the Monkey Island games they tried to emulate, only with too much heavy sarcasm and not enough absurdity. The graphics are bright and shiny, the characters even occasionally have a bit of real-life spark to them, and there are a hell of a lot of puzzles to solve (plus a few fetch quests). When the occasional hilarious moments clicked, it almost made it all worth it.

My biggest problem with it was the utterly plodding pace everyone shuffled at, and with such a huge world, you could catch a nap walking between areas. With zero in-game tutorial, there was no way to know that a double-click made you run, until a puzzle near the end through was unsolvable if you didn't, so I had to go online and find out that the game screwed me. Combine that with terrible pathing, where you take the longest route and walk in circles to get to anything, and it was a dull, frustrating game. The horrible camera contributes significantly; they tried to make it as cinematic as possible with fixed cameras that turn with you, but half the time that just means you have to click every two seconds to keep walking. Some of the swooping effects are nice, but interfere with gameplay whenever you want to click on something while you're walking. The cinematic experience was kind of broken anyway, when everyone looks off into space while talking to each other and  uses the exact same hand gesture.

Compared to that constant irritation, the occasional insane puzzle (or insane chapter, as Amanda's seemed to be), and the expected heaping bugs that every adventure game has weren't as bad. They just meant I ended up leaning on a walkthrough at times to figure out what one thing I'd missed somewhere, and occasionally rage quitting for a few days when it crashed again.

I think I truly came to hate it when I found a good fix, and Jack said, ""No, that would be the obvious solution. I feel like some challenge. Let's try it another way....""

Ultimately, I grimly finished it just because I'd already invested so much time, but it became an endurance that I wouldn't wish on anyone. A little polish would have taken the game into the timeless classic realm, but instead it ended up average and forgettable.",False,66
12340,"Can't complain much about the game that only cost $1.99. I don't play a lot of point-and-click adventure game, but this game is not too bad compare to some of same genre games that I have played. Funny story, decent graphic, smooth gameplay. Played the game none stop till the end. Since I had a great time, I gonna buy the sequel as well.",True,34
12340,"Disappointing.

That pretty much sums up my reaction to Jack Keane. Jack Keane has decent graphics, controls reasonably well, and even made me chuckle once or twice. Why do I not recommend it then?

The puzzles are badly designed and I can not count the amount of times I found myself saying, ""What am I supposed to do?"" No, not wondering how to solve a puzzle. I found myself wondering what I should even be trying to solve. The problem is that the game does not clearly establish what the puzzles are. Jack rarely offers even the remotest clue about what he thinks of a puzzle and it is extremely easy to miss a key item just because you ran past it. 

I adore adventure games and love great puzzles, but this game was a misfire. I might even try the sequel just to see if they fixed the problems, but this one misses more than it hits and can not get  recommendation from me. 

I'd give it a 4/10.",False,23
12340,"I spent a lot of time playing this game. I initially purchased it because it was on sale and I had a lot of free time. The controls were kind of dodgy and the puzzles were challenging enough ( I remember having to look up a decent amount of them). The humor reminded me somewhat of a knock off of Monkey Island. It has some replayability for some hidden items, but once you found them there's no real reason as the story is kind of unoriginal for  If you're a fan of classic Point and Click adventures I would give it a try, but wait until it is on sale.",True,18
12340,"Now this is kinda difficult to review. This game is practically the same as Ankh 3. There would be nothing wrong with that, IF Ankh 3 would not be exacty the same as Ankh 2 and Ankh 2 was any different from Ankh. This is just not funny anymore. To make long story short, buy this game only if You hadn't played anything else from Deck 13. You can enjoy like 5 hours of this humor. If You played all the Ankh games, you are likely to have spent 50 hours with Deck 13 and that is just too much.

Graphics is terrible, there are MANY small bugs (especially comments of some objects that are obviously wrong, some labels are missing completely being replaced with some development debug macros and so on). The camera is horrible, in the menu I cannot see any cursor so it always takes quite a time before I guess it's position and highlight the option I want, and having multiple monitors adds some more problems like the cursor won't stop at the edge of the main screen and often you click out of the game's window making it minimized (from the technical perspective this is the worst game I have ever played) It also takes a really long time to go back to the game after this happens. And the worst of all: All the puzzles, if you can call it like that, are absolutely ilogical and just stupid and the obvious solutions to the situatation just do not work with no indication of explanation or whatever. Well you can call that funny only if it is your first game from Deck 13. The game is also pretty childish (you can't even hit a monkey, that the developers made sure you will learn to hate a great deal throughout the game, while it is tearing your airplane apart during the flight and you need to figure out a way to put it safely down while the very fate (of course) of the world is at stake). On the other hand there are quite a lot of erotic undertone and ambiguity - so you can't really tell which group do the developers really try to target.

BUT even then I was somehow able to play the game till the end (although with some swearing and curses) and I must confess I kinda liked it so it was not all that bad. As I have already mentioned several times: I think You will like it depending on how many of Deck 13 game you have already played.",False,18

The Gold pack is an updated version of classic edition, v1.12 as opposed to classic's v1.05/1.06. It is recommended that you use v1.12 for mods like Stracciatella (which I am using), the mod ""v1.13."" With the Gold Pack you get both Jagged Alliance 2 1.12 and Unfinished Business.

There's alot of conflicting accounts on whether or not classic edition will work with these mods, but ultimately the version you go with is probably fine? But again, I have no way of confirming this without using those mods myself.

This game is old. By default, it does not run on Windows 10/11. At all. The 2 hours I have in this is running a blackscreen doing nothing. You almost definitely will not run this game vanilla.
[b]There are plenty of compatibility mods available which will make it work.[/b] Stracciatella is one such mod, which helps not only with compatibility but also adds some quality of life improvements while largely keeping the game the same. 1.13 updates the combat a good bit, but I believe that also helps with compatibility.

This game is good. If you like CRPGs, it's great. It does have an initial learning curve, the first run or two might not work perfectly but eventually you pick it up. As this is an old game, probably [b]READ THE MANUAL[/b] it helps, trust me.

Two sides, two advantages, capture mechanics (it's been a very long time, i remember capturing something), generate your power levels unlock new buildings, build units to defend or attack, turn towers into defences, use ground or water as weapons. Create a long gameplay by flooding back the enemy using water, or build the tallest plateu with ground. Artillery is an option.

The game had much promise, very similar to maelstrom, but of course without the masses of armies and first person view of a hero.

That all being said, the problem is how the game is not going to work for everyone, it ran out of compatibility for some systems, while it had compatibility for others with the same hardware, go figure.

I enjoyed it while it lasted when i first had it, but eventually after changing systems i couldn't play it without a crash. Also the variety and diversity in the end just run out, nothing new to do, nothing new to find, just kill that in your own way capture that somehow, etcetcetc. A one way ticket to a game that has no real end, until you decide when you had enough.",True,65
12420,"A game that LOST its roots.

The game passed to another developper and another publisher. Things got worst.

I explain. The designers tried to differenciate things more by building the races in a different way.
In this game we have ONLY two races comparing to the 3 plus the scourge we had in the first Perimeter, the Exodus and the HeartBack.
So, the story says that the new world those races were searching finally found. But the Exodus still can colonize the surface while the HeartBack can build in Water.

If you are a Perimeter Veteran please read the differences below, after the many dashes.

For the Newcomers to this game.

Here we have a simple strategy game. You first build the energy cores and terraform the ground so you can move easily or build upon it. To do that on the easy way build every NEXT energy core to the change of the levels of the ground and press the terraform button of the NEW energy core. In other ways you'll get yourself saying some bad words if NOT smushing the PC or leaving the game completely. The manual terraforming controls are buggy so don't be frustrated. The only thing you'll need the manual terraforming is when you want to get some blue crystals and you'll need to dig the ground.

Every technology as the game says must be researched first. So if you want to build unit factories you need to research them first. So level 2 and 3 factories. The factories create the pop cap. But you can't have as many factories as you want as the preserve energy. The units from the factories have ground and air mode. You change them dependant on what you want to attack or defend because ground units don't fight air.

Generally is a very simple game that tricks your imagination. Nothing more.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have played the first Perimeter....

The game differences are Massive.

--There is no Frame here. No main building. No King of Chess. You start building like any other strategy game.
--The energy cores can be built anywhere at start. The terraform process is included in them and can be set at automatic mode or manual. Manual terraforming is crap. You use it only to level the ground where you want and then auto. The controls for the manual are buggy. A very easy way to keep the level of the ground the same(but you lose space) is to build the energy cores to the gaps that the ground changes levels. When you press the terraform button the ground will be in the same level as the OLD energy core. But as you can see in this game you have to be occupied even to that.
--Population cap is related to the factories and is NOT standard as in the first game. Every factory places about 2 more squads and the squad units number is about 1-4 dependant on the unit. Factories preserve energy like in Command and Conquer and NOT like in the first Perimeter when ONLY working. In this way the squad number is limited. 
--You have a Research Center to advance your technology. To build the 3-set level of factories you have to research them as much other techs like PLUS in Weapons or Shields for your units. The first level builds light units, the second level medium units and the third heavy units that are effective in buildings most.
--So we have ONLY 3 units per race that can be changed from ground to air and vice versa depedant of the opponents offensive and defensive. For example fighters confront fighters and the vehicles other vehicles. There is NO unit from the ground to hit the air.
--The chess game that we were playing in the first Perimeter with the capturing of the energy cores or buildings of the opponent is VERY limited here, because the Exodus structures are damaged from water and the HeartBack structures from the normal ground.
--There are NO subterrastrial units on this game.
--Ahh yes, I almost forgot. New power-ups like Nukes,mass terra destruction and such are coming from the blue ingame crystals like OLD techs that you find on the planet's surface. To get those crystals you'll need to build an energy core on them and MANUALLY terraform the ground in DIGGING mode.

12430,"9/13/2021 - A new perspective on this game, considering many games came out after this:

WOW, is all I can say about this creation. Before anyone asks, no, I'm not changing my stance, because of what's happened since, but with a concept like freeform nudging, this is WAY ahead of its time. 

We have had many different pinball games with great physics, but most of them fall short. Pinball Arcade steers the ball as part of its nudging, FX3 suffers from nudge passing especially on recreations, and mainly, nudging overall is incredibly simplistic with single press, full-strength nudging. Even VPX suffers similarly to FX3. Pro Pinball is an exception with analog-based keyboard nudging, but Slamit takes it a step further, utilizing custom nudges depending on how many keys you pressed and which ones. For a 2009 game that utilizes custom strengths, lights, and other options, the work they poured into this is seriously impressive.

Given the current conditions, however, I can't recommend this due to problems on modern-day systems, including choppy framerates (Steam's in-game FPS disagrees somehow...?). This is no fault of the developers, however, and it's a truly tragic tale to be told and why there's no support behind SlamIt. One of the lead devs actually died in a car crash shortly after it released. If you want to get this game for preservation's sake, go for it. Otherwise, steer clear and look for a more enjoyable pinball experience.

I hope this project (or the SlamIt nudging system at least) is revived one of these days, in this series or another.

The puzzles are elite and I have to admit that I've had to use a walkthrough to get through a couple of the puzzles, but it's not impossible! The story line is an A+. However, there are a few things that should change, starting with the movement. The walking is VERY slow and can get annoying at times. I would also change the camera views to allow people to control the view themselves. The camera view in this game is automatic and causes trouble at times. Sound track is pretty good and the game is sorta humerous! The talks with each individual in the game allows you to choose different subjects to talk about, but it's up to you to find out which conversation will lead you to the next task in the game. Overall, I give this game a 9/10! I got the game on sale, but I would pay full price if I had to.",True,16
12440,"I've seen plenty of sequels that want to rely so heavily on building up to the third installment that the story goes missing (I'm looking at you, Dragon Age II!), but I've rarely seen a second game that uses the first as it's crutch. Mainly because that's such a stupid idea, and yet that's pretty much what Ankh 2 seems to be doing a lot of. I've never played the first, but with how many things are mentioned for happening in the first game and how little is explained at whatever the hell is going on when I jump in the game, leaving me with this subliminal message to get Ankh 1 (Which I won't, because of how pestered I was).

 In the end, I was left with my imagination to fill in what happened in the Ankh 1... and that's not a good thing to do. 

If you make a sequel, it should have elements of it's predecessor, but still be able to stand on it's own. Come on Ankh 2! Look over at Mass Effect 2, Arkham City, and Assassin's Creed II. They're doing it just fine! Even Final Fantasy can make a game that stands on it's own... about 15 completely different ways, though. 

But that isn't the only thing that made me dislike Ankh 2. The game's graphics, while cartoony and colorful, have poor texturing and the game likes to do the occaisional zoom in on some of the objects, which made me sneer at my laptop screen.

On top of that, the story is urine poor (I'm allowed to say ""urine"", right?). There are a few jokes that hit me with the ""nostril snort and slight smirk"" reaction, but these are very few. Most of them are incredibly cheesey- just like the voice actors. And they're all pretty much rubbish. Except for Moses. He was decent. But everyone else was very obviously acting. 

The story also wants to hit these serious moments and build up this particular love triangle when I had no absolute belief in either because of how odd the former stood out like sore thumbs and how forced the latter felt. Along with that, the story's biggest flaw is caused mainly by the gameplay which is about as slow as a donkey with two broken legs and no carrot in front of it's face. Characters- even when running- are hardly going that fast and always maintain the same animation- which is alright for a casual scene. But in suspense, action, and intense scenes- these really bring all that feeling down to a screeching halt. 

Along with the occasional game flops, like screen glitches and crashes. There was one point that I had played four hours worth of the game and was close to beating it, and I accidentally saved just as the game broke on me, and I ended up having to go all the way back and rush to where I left off.

Another huge problem is the logic of this game. Sure, it's like many point-and-click puzzle games (where the most specific, strange things can solve puzzles, even when other objects in your inventory could suit the job just as easily), but honestly. How was I supposed to know that a doll with it's head popped off should hold a candle? Or that I should use the Eleventh Commandment Tablet as a wrecking ball? OR that I can split a coconut with a cuckoo-clock's bird and use said coconut to revive a parrot?

And my final complaint, is more of something I just noticed when I was getting towards the end of the game. How to Thara and Assil have the magic ability to telepathically communicate to each other during puzzles so that one on the opposite side of the stadium knows that they need to direct a sunbeam produced by another and reflect it right back at them?

I'm going to play Ankh 3 not because I want to, but because foolishly bought both and now it's just sitting there, staring at me in my inventory- and the slight charm of this game which existed as much as a fly's fart in the midst of a tornado. To those looking to play this game, play at your own risk. If you like puzzles... play at your own risk. If you like parodies of Egyptian society... I suppose you'll like this. If you like weird B-movie stories... I guess you'll like this too. But only buy it on discount. I'd never pay the full price for this.",False,9

I can remember one moment, for instance, when I had to shoo away an aggressive cat. I had in my inventory a piece of chicken but trying to use this to complete the objective resulted simply in my character shaking their head and saying, very robotically, ""Hmm... this doesn't work.""

12450,"Can I just say how odd it is that Ankh 2 and 3 have such epic-sounding titles, but are reduced to nothing more than standard puzzle solving with heavily-skewed logic and tons of stiff, dry humor. To be honest, in some respects  I like Ankh 3 more than Ankh 2. What about Ankh 1, you may ask? I've personally had enough to do with these games that I have no desire to see how it all started. But thanks for the offer, Steam. 

Why do I like Ankh 3 more than Ankh 2? Probably only one reason- the worlds are more colorfully and creatively designed. They're prettier to look at. But Ankh 3 does about everything else worse than Ankh 2. The story is cluttered and messy, with tons of ideas picked up then dropped (you get drunk and have a random dream of shooting a chicken out of rocket launcher that has no context, no build up for the story, and no humor to it). The puzzles are even more incredibly strange and painful to solve because they make no bloody sense. The new voice actors are leagues worse than those of Ankh 2. And, as I complained in Ankh 2, Ankh 3 relies too much on it's predecessors. 

It doesn't make any self-aware game jokes like Ankh 2, but there are a lot of reoccuring characters and ideas brought up you'll have no idea of what they are unless you've played at least Ankh 2. And the story tries to take all these silly shenanigans and cliche humor (especially from the ankh. Yeah, it can talk in this one and I hate the bloody thing. I forgot why it was so damn important halfway through the game, and just wanted to toss it), and make it seem big, climactic and important but seeing where everything was built off of, I had no reason to think anything like that. 

I despise Ankh 2 and 3, and they're currently my least favorite games in my library. I won't even call them the Ankh games anymore. I might as well call them the ""wankh"" games, because that's essentially was they are, and especially what Wankh 3: Butt of the Gods is. Do not buy this game.

[h1][b]How to play Port Royale 2 on Windows 10 (for AMD users)[/b]
Von Mitsukuni[/h1]

""1. First step...
...is make the game playable. (Otherwise it won't even start in Windows 10.)

Go to your default game directory. Usually;
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Port Royale 2
Right-click on PR2.exe -> Properties
On Compatibility tab, check ""Run this program in compatibility mode for:""
Select ""Windows 98 / Windows ME""

2. Game is working but...
...it's so pixelated and sea texture is messed up. To prevent this, open AMD Radeon Settings.

On Gaming tab, find Port Royale 2 profile and click.
Most of these settings are turned off by default. We're gonna turn them on.
- Anti-aliasing Mode -> Select ""Override application settings"", than select ""8xEQ"" from Anti-aliasing Level.
- Anti-aliasing Method -> Select ""Supersampling""
- Morphological Filtering -> You can toggle on this setting but i didn't see any major differences.
- Anistrophic Filtering Mode -> Select ""Override application settings"", than select ""16x"" from Anistrophic Filtering Level.
- Texture Filtering Quality -> Select ""High""
- Keep ""AMD optimized"" for Shader Cache and Tessellation Mode

3. Sea texture is fine now and...
...there is only one problem left. Everything is pixelated. To use anti-aliasing settings enabled, we need one last retouch.

Open Port Royale 2 configuration
Check ""Execute in full-screen mode"" (This option is a necessity, otherwise anti-aliasing won't applied)
Check other options too, except ""Use colored hardware mouse cursor"".

And voilà
Just like the old times.""",True,56
12470,"i started the game with high expectation, because many veteran reviewers commented favorlably.

I'm a senior old gamer, so retro graphic is ok, merchant part is repetive? it's no problem.Rather, it's fun.
Buy low and sell high and build facilities to produce goods.......all fun.

But one thing i can't put up with......WHY MUST I FIGHT ENEMY FLEET WITH ONLY ONE SHIP?

i can build a fleet up to ten ships.
But when battle begins, only JUST ONE of my ships fights while enemy fleet attacks with 5 ships.
when the first ship was defeated(got sunk), you swim back to another ship and challenge again.

Is this a joke?
sadly, i couldn't notice this fatal system until 4 hours playing, so i can't request refund.

Maybe some old fans say, ""Hey, it's an old game"" or ""This is not a naval combat game, but a trading game.""
But i was very dissapointed at the joke-like sea battle system.

Somewhere i read the concept of this game ""make money, bulid fleet, conquer the caribbean economically and forcefully""

Well, at least half of it was a lie. 


",False,54
12470,"A very engrossing and very deep 17th century economic simulator.  You start as a small time trader with a small ship, a warehouse, and a purse of gold. From there you buy goods cheaply at one port and sail off to other ports and hope to find one that will buy those goods at a high price. Once you obtain enough capital you increase in rank. Rank increases allow you to hire more captains to have separate fleets, and obtain more building permits in different ports. 

The economic depth is amazing. Each port is capable of producing 5 different goods. Some goods production is dependant on having a supply of another good, and that's where you the trader comes in. Do you want to buy rope from Port A? Then they need a good supply of hemp from Port B. Furthermore, once you obtain a building permit in a particular port you can become a greater part of the local economy by building your own warehouse and then manufacturing facilities. If you are smart enough and have the gold you can buy basic crop plantations in one port, produce that good cheaply, haul the goods to your advanced manufacturing facility at another port to cheaply produce the finished good and sell it for a massive profit. For extra profit you can also build housing for the new workers for your faciliteis and have them pay you rent. You also make money buy shipping in surplus workers from other ports to the port that now needs those workers. 

Not that there aren't plenty of obstacles to stand in your way. When the game starts out in free play there are no pirates active and no nations are at at war.  As the game progresses the four nations, Spain, France, England, and the Netherlands can and will end up at war with each other. You can attempt to stay friendly with each nation and continue selling to all sides or offer to help one side over the other by raiding ship, blockading ports, and attacking ports.  Doing so rewards you, but at the cost of not being able to do business with the other nation until you repair your status with them. 

Piracy is your other main concern. Pirates start off weak, with a single ship, but quickly grow to a major problem. They will sack ships, and invade ports. The sacking of ports is of great concern if you have a warehouse in that town as they will steal all of your stored goods, otherwise it is a great opportunity to sell the newly ravaged port fresh supplies. You can mitigate the risk of having your favorite port raided by pirates and enemy nations by donating cannons and paying for soldiers at your personal expense, and it is VERY expensive, so don't bother until you are wealthy and have something worth protecting. You could try to kill the pirates, but the game will not let you attack the pirates base until it randomly shows up on the map. Once you do know the secret location you must have a both a massive (expensive) battlefleet and a letter of Marquee allowing you to attack them. Why you need permission to kill non-Marquee Letter holding pirates is a bit of a mystery. That is about as historically accurate as all the white guys who work on your sugar plantations that you pay wages to. 

While the game is incredibly deep, it suffers from having ZERO in-game help or tutorials. It took me three full days of playing to realize I could have my warehouses auto-buy goods when they were cheap so that I didn't have to micro manage them. The same is possibly with your trade convoys but I haven't been able to fully figure it out yet. Finding an online guide is a must for full enjoyment. 

There are even deeper aspects of the game and economy, but it would take a book to get in to them all. If you are a lover of deep economic sims this game is 100% for you. 
",True,27
12470,"I can't be the only person who's gotten a pirate ship or spaceship and spent all their time hauling junk around to sell. There's something quietly gratifying about buying low and selling high, and so there should be no surprise there are games that exist to scratch that itch. Port Royale 2 does just that on the surface, and then surprises you with several more layers of fortune-seeking options.

You play an aspiring merchant in the Caribbean of the 1600s, starting with little more than a sloop and some sacks of money. Your ship will get you around to the many ports, each modeled in simple, charming Stronghold-esque 2D. The buildings that comprise each town determine what goods they produce from a list of about two dozen, and the rate at which they consume them. Your job, then, is to learn which towns need which goods, and where the best place to buy them up is.

It's not as simple as finding a town that makes shirts and a town that grows cotton, though. Each location is constantly producing and consuming goods, and their prices are determined by dynamic supply and demand. So, if you bring a huge load of cotton to shirt town you might make a pile of money, but turn around and do it again and that cotton might be worthless because they haven't used up the first load yet. Success in the mercantile business means making circuits around the sea, picking up whatever you can at bargain-basement prices and unloading it at whatever port happens to need it. The world map helpfully displays what good a town needs the most at the time, but there are plenty of other traders who can beat you to the punch.

The dynamic, living world of Port Royale is what keeps it fresh and entertaining, because not only will demand flip on you, you can be the agent of that change. Strike enough deals in a town and they'll grant you building permits to set up your own farms and workshops, allowing you to add new production sources across the map. With enough capital you can move away from buying and selling random goods and instead working your own supply chains for pure profit. You can have enormous merchant fleets at your disposal, moving around huge loads of goods or broken up across the Caribbean to beat the other traders to the punch.

Somehow the developers didn't think that was enough, so if you want to eschew the merchant life for full privateering, even that's an option. Any ship can be designated a warship and outfitted with cannon and sailors to take on pirates or merchants of other nations, or even besiege and ransack ports. Governors in major towns will even give you missions to eliminate particularly troublesome captains if you need guidance. There's real-time combat between ships that's functional but basic compared to other high-seas simulators, and comes with the odd handicap of letting you command one ship at a time while your opponents have their full fleet.

Still, the combat is an engaging and welcome addition atop the robust economic simulator, and it isn't even the only one. You can also choose to ferry around settlers and construction materials to help grow towns, gamble in the many taverns of the world, piece together treasure maps, and more. A series of four extensive tutorial scenarios will help you get a grip on the game, and then you have four challenge scenarios or the wide-open freeplay mode to enjoy. The chunky 2D graphics might not have aged very well but they certainly don't detract from the relaxed atmosphere, and the soundtrack is exactly what you'd want in a low-key trading sim. Anyone with even a passing interest in being a high-seas merchant is sure to find something to enjoy here.

12480,"I picked up this Russian made RTS game in the Steam sale.
The game is a tactical level RTS that follows the the 9th Company of the 345th OPPD through 9 years of warfare in Afghanistan against the insurgents and yes it is the same 9th Company in the film 9th Company. The game even has clips from the film.
The campaign is good but short and you do a nice variety of missions. The tutorial at the start is comprehensive enough for you to get a quick grasp of the controls.
It also has some nice realistic elements. Soldiers can get injured and can't fight until attended by a medic and if you're not fast enough may die from their injuries. You also get off screen support fro missions such as D-30 artillery strikes, rocket artillery and Hind CAS (all of which are extremely deadly) and so on. If you lose your radioman you lose your access to support. For some missions you get armoured vehicles to control and if these get hit you can bail the crews before the vehicle brews up. It's best to take care of them as they provide a great fire-power advantage over your enemy.
The game does have issues though nothing severe. You can't map your own controls and moving the camera around is quite sluggish. The AI have a tendency to wander off and attack enemies though this may be down to me not knowing the best way to control the troops. For some reason all of your soldiers are privates apart from a couple of warrant officers. There's also some translation errors but this is forgiveable. There are also two missions with some bugs that force you to reload in order to get through them. also  there is a mod for the game that improved it a bit .

Some might find the fact that your reallly need to keep close watch on all your troops movements at all times, especially if you split them up into 2 groups for a 2 pronged attack, a bit tedious, but I liked having to be constantly aware of my soldiers because you never could tell where the enemy would hit you next or when you would run into a MG nest.  If I had to pic anything that was annoying, it woul dbe the AI's constant targeting of my medics, but to be honest, that made it that much more challenging and realist, 'cause the enemy probably would target medics if RL anyway.

12510,"This game is terrible. 

For starters, there is no tutorial. The game thrusts you right in with the options of Mens Prison, Womens Prison or Military Prison. It does not explain what the differences are between them (if there are any at all) or what each prison will actually involve, you're just expected to guess.
I went with the first option. Mens Prison. 
Once in the game there is no guide on what to do, no objectives, nothing helpful at all. It doesn't even clearly show you which plot of land you should be building on which is annoying as first impressions. 
Once you start to figure things out on your own, such as how the menus work, what you should be building and such, you expect the game to get better but it doesn't. 
It's drab attempts at being a 'prison tycoon' just makes you frustrated and bored. The learning curve is huge and i'm sure there's many things i'm missing because the game just doesn't explain to you what to do or how to do it (apart from the 'manual' which i've given a read and it isn't very helpful). 

The graphics are average for the release date but when the gameplay is boring the drab graphics don't do anything to help ignite your enthusiasm and the same goes with the menus and other interface options. They are downright ugly, and 90% of the times the options are not labelled and do not explain to you what they do, there is just a random picture which you yourself must decipher. 

I'm sure if I put another 10 hours into the game I may learn how to play it fully, but I doubt that even if I did learn the more complicated parts of it I would still not find the game enjoyable. 
There are many better tycoon games out there for your money, I just can't recommend this at all.",False,143

12510,"First off, this is a pretty old game. It was released in 2007, so don't expect 2014 graphics. You start with an area of land and an amount of cash to start your prison. You first need to put some fencing up, plop a place for the inmates to sleep and a security building. From there you just continue to expand until all available buildings have been placed and you have your prison. It took me a few prisons to get the hang of what you need to do so inmates aren't constatntly jumping the fence and making a runner for it. On my fourth or fifth prison I finally got the hang of security and that was when I was able to excell to Max Security. 

Given how old this game is, I'm surprised I didn't have to use compatibility mode. If you have some problems with starting the game try using xp sp2 compatibility mode. It has a fair few bugs that can be worked around, fencing is easy to make a mess of which leads to crashes etc. Guard patrols for the most part work fine, but can crash if you try to issue too many commands to the same guard too quickly. In essence, if you can master the guards and security you can get some pretty pumping prisons going. 

The game has a long learning curve, even with the manual having a bit of detail in it. It wasn't until close to 7 hours of gameplay that I had that ""ahhh, so that's what you have to do"" moment, and I've played a lot of tycoon/simulation games before.

Not too bad of a game, but once you figure it out, there's not a lot of depth left.

I was lucky enough to grab this for $2.49 on the steam sale and if you can get it for that price I would say it's money well spent if you like tycoon games.",True,20

12530,"This is a long review for those who want to know all details of the game. Long story short, this is a very nostalgic open world classic where you can basically do whatever you want. You can hunt 8 different areas, all ranging around the world, and HU2010 even adds a few more. You can hunt the Southern Rockies: a hidden gem brimming with versatility, accommodating noob and seasoned hunters alike. The South Central Plains: where hunters wither under the sun every year in pursuit of game ranging from antelope to bison. The Central Rockies: a rugged hunter's paradise blessed with gorgeous vistas and mighty trophy elk. The Southwest: where unforgiving cactus-covered valleys and ponderosa highlands molded America's most elusive big game. The Upper Midwest: a highly sought after hunting ground where world class bucks roam these impenetrable forests and sprawling farmlands. The Pacific Northwest: another beginner hotspot for those seeking some of North America's finest trophy game among luxuriant temperate rainforests. The Northern Rockies: a forlorn, cruel wilderness renowned for its untreaded peaks and untouched animal populations. And finally, Africa: a vast, scorched land with more trophy hunters than animals, all searching for exotic wonders like the portly kudu, cunning lion, and the colossal elephant. 
You can hunt 16 animals ranging from Wild Turkey to Elephants, all hyper-sensitive to your noises and movements in each unique world. Just remember, while some animals pose no danger and can be hunted safely, others may turn in the blink of an eye and take YOUR life to protect theirs. 
You are also provided with a wide variety of weapons to choose from to go on your trips. Remember, choose the right caliber that suits you and the animal for ethical hunting, the weapon you use is up to you. The weapons range in various types: including bows, handguns, rifles, and shotguns- all with unique ballistics, calibers, and bullet weight (this game does a surprisingly great job with ballistics).
The render distance is incredible. If you stand on a mountain, you can basically see every animal on the map. I've shot animals from 2,000 yards away in this game. To shoot long distances, you need to zero your rifle to the desired distance, which can be practiced at the shooting range. Hunting Unlimited is a paradise for extreme sharpshooters.
This game has a lot of content. The game gives you more than enough equipment to hunt each species; decoys, scent sprays, portable blinds and stands, you name it. For deer alone, you get like 5 different types of lures. As mentioned before, there is also a heap of weapons and weapon types, and every map is rather large. This game has infinite replayability. The next game in the series, HU2010, has even more content.
Animal AI is very good, they're almost as smart as they are in real life; sometimes even smarter. In most games, animals will pretend to not notice you sprinting 200 yards away, upwind, wearing bright pink clothes. In this game, I've spooked antelope from 400. This makes the game quite challenging, but it feels very rewarding to kill something with a bow.

But now, we unfortunately have to go with the flaws.
First off, the repetitive, yet annoying walking sound is just terrible, just ignore that. What's worse is the painfully slow walking speed that does not resemble anything close to a human's average walking speed-- a crab could go faster. The horse, a four-legged 8 foot long animal, seems like it actually walks SLOWER than your character. You can only run with it, but that obviously scares away close animals you can't see (as mentioned before, animal AI is superb).
Physics are a bit wonky-- unsurprisingly for an old game. With vehicles you can't go too fast or you'll fly all over the place and die. When you take down an animal with your weapon(s), the animal just stops abruptly and falls over on it's side with a basic animation. There really isn't any ragdoll or variation in animations.
Quite important: there is an error that has persisted for Windows users where customers reported that after a certain amount of hours they were unable to start the game ever again. This happened to me after about 17 hours gameplay, so beware before purchasing on Steam. This is a very old game, so don't expect it to be fixed. However, I have HU2010 which is better than this version, so it's not a problem anymore.
The graphics are terrible. Deer Hunt 5 from 2001 had more natural graphics, and that's hard to achieve. The colors are often too vibrant, so it kind of looks like play-doh.
Remember how I said animal AI is superb? There is one area it's not: lures. Unless you're within 75 yards of an animal, most lures except decoys and bait are basically useless, and by that point you don't really need lures anymore unless you're going for a bow shot. This means to get a bow shot on game like elk that have no decoys, you need to either A). crawl in front of the herd without spooking it, hoping they don't change direction (if walking is so slow, you can imagine how slow crawling is) or B). get lucky and have a herd walk close enough for you to call them in. Option A is extremely painful unless you're a really dedicated hunter who loves the challenge. I once snuck up to a 236 scoring moose (for those who don't know, that's REALLY good) for 1 real life hour before I even came within calling distance of it. Not to mention, it was walking toward me half the time.

But I don't think that will stop me from recommending this game, this is an awesome game. I recommend it for people like me who just want to have fun, the game is very light-hearted and has tons of playability, but I DON'T recommend it for die-hard hunters looking for an entirely realistic hunting simulator. If you're looking for a hyper-realistic hunting experience, I recommend both theHunter games, or even some older classics like Deer Hunter 5 or Trophy Hunter 2003. If anything, I highly suggest you buy Hunting Unlimited 2010 over this because it's almost the same game with even more content. However, I purchased the game for the heavy nostalgic value it carries, and had tons of fun playing it, even if my fun was short-lived. Despite its flaws, this game is a blast.",True,8

The minigames are optional (they give more clues) but they're fun; there's a memory game, Fake Tetris and some kind of speed thing that isn't particularly difficult.  Still, it's a lot of terrible ideas that, all put together, make a really good, compelling whole.  Way better for that Mahjongg itch than most of the ones with over-the-top pseudo-Asian themes.",True,20
12540,"I can't even remember how I ended up with this game, but I just tried it out, and I'm impressed. It's nothing flashy, but it's solid. As you solve Mahjongg boards (with non-traditional tiles), some tiles give you clues toward solving a mystery. Your goal is to make a Carmen Sandiego/Guess Who-style identification of the suspect(s) based on identifying details and obtained clues.

I enjoy Mahjongg, and I enjoyed this. It's a fun game, with straightforward puzzle gameplay and tutorials to gradually introduce you to your crime-solving tools.",True,8
12540,"Why can't a game ever bring up 'TRUE CRIME'? Why does it always have to be fictional? I don't get it. Do developers fear lawsuits? Are they not aware how big the 'True Crime' business industry already is? All they have to do is go down to a book store and read. Alas the closest I have played so far to 'True Crime' is 'L.A Noire' and they took a whole range of liberties with that one believe me. 

Mah-jong Investigations is developed by a company which disbanded in 2009 http://www.mobygames.com/company/zemnott-inc . The game is somewhat similar to 'Criminal Case' found on Facebook but take out the Hidden Object Games and replace them with Mah-jong solitaire and instead of watching the case play out entirely itself, here you have to do some very babyish deductive work.

For those that don't know this is 'Mah-jong solitaire' (mah-jong itself is a completely different game) its a puzzle game based on finding the same tile strategy. The goal is to match open pairs of identical tiles and remove them from the board, exposing the tiles under them for play. The game is finished when all pairs of tiles have been removed from the board or when there are no exposed pairs remaining.

This games biggest appeal is also its greatest flaw let me explain. You play as a detective whose ultimate goal is to raise yourself up 10 ranks in the 83rd precinct until you become a 'Deputy Commissioner'. Every time you’re presented with a case and a map with several locations of interest. Once you visit a location a mah-jong solitaire game is laid down and as you match up certain 'special tiles' they have a direct impact on your case and also offers you an extra mini game here and there.

Magnify Glass - Means often mundane information will be presented to you such as there was a country music cd found at the crime scene. Does this have any relevance to the case? No. So you just ignore it.

DNA Pattern - This tile means that some DNA evidence needs to be analysed and you can match up a person's DNA with the evidence found if you would like. It means that you have to play a Tetris style mini game using arrow keys which feels somewhat awkward and long especially if you are checking it out against the wrong person. DNA evidence may not be applicable against perp 1 but it could be applicable against perp 2 or the other half the dozen suspects standing in your queue of queries. So more often than not you will learn to ignore this option.

Police Car - Not sure if this tile is connected but eventually you have to play a minigame each case where the police car is trying to a catch a suspected culprit and you have to link up matching tiles flashed in a trail behind the speeding car or the car gets away. This is actually quite fun at first, but the further you rank up it starts to get ridiculous in speed and time requirements and you soon learn it has no real bearing to the ultimate outcome of your case so you just ignore and let the car just speed away.

Security Camera - Adds additional perpetrators of a crime to your case. Instead of just finding one guy you might now need to find 4. These tiles you can't ignore. The game will request you to find the perps whether you click on them or not.

Fingerprint - These tiles often reveal info more pertinent to your case such as 'perp 1 has blonde hair', problem is that you might have a dozen suspects in your line up with blonde hair, so more often than not you will just learn to ignore this.

Telephone - Not sure if this tile is linked up, but your forever answering the bleeding phone and having people tell you mundane info like 'Barry likes Westerns'. Seriously I'm in the middle of a police chase and someone has to phone up and tell me that. Can't I hire a secretary? Since people lie on the phone, you will learn to completely ignore this facet.

Interrogation - You can play a mini game on each suspect which requires you to play a memory match up game like you have 20 chance to find the pairs to 48 tiles. Basically ridiculously impossible odds and so you will learn to ignore this.

Alibi - Finally the only tile that has a definite bearing on your case. Each time you match up one of these it takes a suspect off your line up because they have revealed a iron clad alibi. Collect enough of these 4 mah-jong solitaire games should do it, you have enough people off your suspect list to work out who committed the crime.

The game with all its additional add-on is dressed up to look like it’s something more than just a mah-jong solitaire game which makes it appealing, but since all those add-ons really don't have a significant impact to your cases you’re really just left with the realization that just playing mah-jong solitaire is your best option if you want to quickly move through the ranks. After about 50 mah-jong solitaire games you start asking yourself will this ever end?

Hence the game’s greatest appeal it's mini games is also its greatest weakness since they have no true bearing and just begin to look like unnecessary clutter. The multiple perps behind this crime is Zemnott. You’re looking for a blonde haired person, a dark brown haired, a bald person, and one who wears glasses, most average build, one tall, and one short, most normal height. Ok now with that info go get them. Wait it seems the culprits made a getaway back in 2009 speeding furiously down the highway, angry customers who hate mah-jong solitaire should start pursuit. HOLD YOUR HORSES! This just in ""BARRY LIKES WESTERNS!!!""

The game was what I was hoping it would be, for the most part. The only slight ding I would put on its report card is that the vocal track of police officers on the radio you hear while playing the game is on a pretty short loop (considering how long it takes to play enough games to reach the top rank).

12540,"Others have described exactly what you do in the game, so I won't go into that.

What I will say is I enjoyed this game immensely and will probably return to it from time to time.  The atmosphere is set well, there's a lot of different elements and a few minigames that all gel well together.  Even though the countdown timer should never have been a concern to me, its presence did make everything feel more urgent (which is something that really annoys me in most games, but didn't in this one).

The one negative is the continuous pop-ups of each new piece of information (Ted Whatshisface weighs 122 pounds!) gets a little annoying towards the end, particularly since with four perps and 20-ish suspects, you don't (and can't) really care about each piece of information but what it all tells you when combined on the case info page.  There really should be an option to turn that off.

Actually, I tell a lie.  There is a second negative, if you're playing the minigame where you're chasing a suspect and you manage to clear all the tiles before the last one appears, it glitches and you can't catch the suspect.  Solution is, when you get down to the last two tiles to wait for them both to appear at the bottom of the screen before clearing them.

Let me begin by saying I've played this game in short intervals depending on my time from basically 2007 to now.
I ended up buying the game cheap from a Babbages back in the day at a mall, and I played it on my XP, so I've got a lot of experience in this game and how it works.

- The design is simple. That is why I play it. -

When I was a kid, I didn't want to play Rollercoaster Tycoon and instead prefered '3D games', but I couldn't afford the newest RC when it came out, so I got this instead. It's fun enough for £1 in the steam sale, surely. I can recommend to begin on a big-ish lot and work your way up. Basically, you begin with however big of a budget you need (starts at 10k, I believe), then you select your advertising preferences, ticket prices, and if you give away free tickets. You don't have to do these things, and can play without. These are limited choices, but it's easy for kids to understand. (And people like me, who just kinda wanna play a bit without actual commitment.)

If you play in sandbox mode, which is what I usually do, the game starts you in your empty lot, if you start with 10k, make it simple at first by choosing a cheap-mid range ride, ticket stand, a generator, a sitting area, bin, two food stalls - either food & drink and a ball game. Theres quite a few to choose from, I usually have one of each, starting with a regular soda stand and a burger one, then advancing onwards towards like Ice cream stand and BBQ chicken etc.

This can be your starting first day to make money. Before you begin your day, go to the menu and click maintence to make sure you have a janitor/repair man. He does everything, I usually get two in my first day. turn your speed to 1/2, close stuff, then repair all the items in your grounds before you start. This is a part of the game that is tedious and annoying, but it's fast enough and takes only a minute. Once you do that, make sure things are open (small stuff like tables and bins open automatically but rides you need to do manually) you can begin your day.

Days end around 10pm and you can start again the next day at 1/2 speed, adding more rides, food stalls, or whatever you need.

I usually start with my basics listed above, and then add onwards. Sometimes if my queue is too long for a ride on the first day, I'll buy another ride to fit in. Just watch your budget.

This is a really simple game and it's enjoyable enough for it's time.
Definately recommended for kids to get them into management games, but theres better ones out there nowadays.

Surprisingly, it was a fun game. I wasn't really expecting a need for speed - esque game with some cool and detailed customization, but there it was. The map was pretty nice too, if a bit linear by design. Unfortunately...

Definitely don't buy it. Nothing about this game works properly and it can't be fixed. And nobody capable of fixing the problem cares enough about it's existence to do it for you.

Some day I would like to see this game be playable, but that is a day that is probably never going to come.

I spent all of 3 dollars on this at sale value and I wasted about that much worth of my time just seeing if there was anything I could do. Valusoft doesn't care. And that's time I'm never getting back. There's something to be said when an old game gets completely abandoned and there is no way to play it without having to revert to obsolete technology, but I honestly can't blame them.

If the game looks cool, you aren't mistaken - underneath the unplayability, this is still a fun street racing game with a ton of stuff to enjoy. But it can't be played it. It's a universal issue with most of the people playing it, especially on new hardware.

What else is there to say -

The car list in the game is quite small, but each car handles differently and gives you plenty of variety. Your starting selection had you pick between a Civic hatchback, a BMW and a Ford F150 - each with their own line of upgrades and a ton of choice in how each vehicle looked. By no means was this anything exceptional, but there was a lot of attention put into how this was handled (in the case of the starter cars - then, there is the cars that you see your opponents drive - I don't want to talk about it).

Then there was the narrative, which doesn't do much more than push you into the next thing to do. And the soundtrack - you'll hear all of it pretty quickly. It isn't bad, but if you were into completing the game, it got repetitive pretty darn quick.

- responsive mechanics
- interesting little features such as: cursor is a light source + it is a character that follows you through the game
- you can reassign skill points if you screwed up character's build
- attacking giant mobs in melee has unique animation
- barrels have physics
- entrances of deeper levels in dungeons are marked on minimap and yes it is supposed to be a disadvantage but if the game was more dynamic it could be interesting to search for it, but this is not the case.

cons:
- spell cooldown is not shown at all
- desert location is almost copied from diablo 2: bluе and green scarabs, humanoid vipers, mummies.
- ridiculously large hitboxes
- weapon type is not shown in the description, you should guess which is two-handed etc, unless it is mentioned in the weapon's name
- no confirmation prompt while assigning skills points
- gold is useless
- no gold autoloot

So the game was released in 2007, the same year as Witcher, Bioshock, C&C3:tiberium wars, Crysis, Mass Effect, Assassin's Creed

12650,"Story
The story is almost nonexistent so I made one to role play as my own. I took the role of a kid with a large supply of LSD going on a permanent trip and raising a dog at the same time. This seemed to fit in well with the rest of the game and the comic sans like text.
Gameplay
I was extremely disappointed in the gameplay. All that you do is move your mouse around and left click. I see what they were shooting for but they seriously need to add more gameplay elements to squeeze out more game time.
The feeding feature in the game is the most important element. If you feed your pet too much basic food their stomach will get fucked and they will become sick and you will have to blow all of your fucking cash on the little bitch. In real life I had to put my dog down when she became sick and the lack of realism really ripped me out of the game. You should be given the option to be able to pay the medical bills or put the dog down. 
Another thing you can do with your doggo is make it do tricks. This piece of the game was also a letdown for me. When the game's text notified me I had unlocked the roll over trick, I attempted to roll over but it then said I hadn't unlocked the ability. This mildly upset me until I grinded to unlock the roll over ability all over again. The ability you would be able to unlock after rolling over is glitched and you cannot unlock it. We may never know what that trick was without a trip into the game's .ini files.
Graphics/Performance
The graphics in this game were extremely underwhelming for the most part but the models created for the dogs were honestly on point. You are given a decent selection of puppers and an unlockable doggo labeled ""special."" I have not yet unlocked the special dog and will update my review if that happens.
The game is stuck, much like Conan the mighty pig and Dark Souls, at 30 frames per second. This demolishes any hopes of you going competitive in this game and you should look to higher tier titles like Golf With Your Friends for any such action.
Music
I usually give positive praise towards games for their nice soundtracks but this game's soundtrack in particular made me want to hang myself by the cord of my mouse. It does not fit in well with the gameplay on screen and actually gave me a headache, forcing me to stop for my own well-being. 
Overall
Pro(s):
•	Decent looking puppers
Con(s):
•	Ear bleeding music
•	Boring gameplay
•	Story takes a lot of imagination from a role player’s perspective 
•	30 FPS
•	Comic sans like text
•	Illusion of choice (Pay medical bills/ kill dog)
•	Glitched parts of the game that are unreachable
•	Boring gameplay
In my greatest attempt to be nice, only buy this game if you are either A) Brain dead or B) Emotionally detached from reality and need to escape to a virtual dog with minimal feedback and few negative responses to give yourself a much needed ego boost after getting your ass whipped by an alcoholic father.
Or if you want to get from 49 games on Steam to 50. Even then only buy it on sale.

[*]Despite being a 2008 title, the graphics have held up incredibly well for being 7 years old (with the added benefit of many of today’s low-spec PCs able to run it).
[*]Extremely detailed damage visuals.
[*]Engaging career mode with a modest yet sufficient number of tracks.  
[*]Very responsive AI, which is arguably better than many of today’s racing titles.  AI difficulty level can be set for each individual race.
[*]Unique race types, such as drifting races (though these can be challenging).
[*]Great value for the money.  Even if you only play 5-10 hours, it still provides more entertainment than a 90-minute movie ticket.

[*]Limited number of cars - but the cars which are included are fan-favorites.
[*]Unrealistic, yet manageable handling.  Almost all the vehicles handle like American muscle cars, and prone to rear tire skidding.  My guess is that the developers tried to develop a physics model somewhere between pure arcade and full simulation.
[*]Non-functional multiplayer.  The official MP servers are dead.  There are some 3rd party unofficial servers which are active, but I haven’t used these.
[*]Lack of Steam achievements.

GRiD (Or formely better known as Race Driver: GRiD) is a 2007 simcade racing game developed by Codemasters, and runs on the Ego engine. GRiD places you in the flesh of a new driver, working their way up from contracts with other teams to creating and managing a team of their own, participating in different tournaments and events around the globe.

The 3 continents available in GRiD have very distinct disciplines and styles: The USA focuses on street racing and muscle cars, Europe focuses on Touring, and Japan focuses on Drifting and Tuners.

As well as racing for your own team, you are also able to have your own teammate on the track, who actually relays information back to you as the race goes: Position, time behind/ahead of you, etc...

The graphics of the game, while now beaten by the game's sequels and successors, still holds up on it's own today, and has a beautiful 'sunset' sheen for most of the enviromments you race in.

Yes, online servers went down awhile ago, but the offine single-player career mode is excellent. Damage mode isn't as well as Burnout Paradise...but hey just saying that is a complement! I like how the CPUs themselves would spin out/make mistakes on their own. I really, really, cannot recommend it enough. I got it on sale for $3, best 3 i've ever spent! GET IT NOW!",True,47

I still play it regularly even though it's 6 years old by now. The SP is great (I spent around 25-30 hours to complete the SP), this game is definately worth it's money!

- Detailed cockpit view
- Single Player
- Graphics
- Physics (mix between arcade and realism)
- Damage model
- LAN play via Hamachi

- Online does not work anymore",True,42
12770,"Love it, played it first over a decade ago after i got my copy from bgamer magazine with the full game included, played it several times then, wondered if i was just being hit by nostalgia when i saw it on sale but bought it anyway, and...

YUP still love playing it, it might have a bit more dialogue than what you would want, but it has its charm and you need it if you want to get more skill pts, 3 types of weapon, with its own styles, plenty of weapons for each style, and armors to boot, allowing you to  need the god powers as little or as much as you want.

although after all these years the game is quite easy  even in legend since i have played many more action rpgs,  this one is up there on the ones that make me come back to the genre. hard to believe its from 2008 tho.",True,1
12790,I dont like it the controls are most annoying.,False,1
12800,The premise of the game makes no sense. Global warming has made this section of the country uninhabitable; so let's race round it in monster trucks to use up all the fuel! Fortunately this has no real bearing on the game. It is a good solid off road racing game. There is a nice range of rugged vehicles and the different race restrictions mean you get to drive most of them. There is a huge open world to drive around in with things to collect. There are some awesome races where you race through tornado storms with things being destroyed all round you. However it could have done with more races like that. The difficulty curve is strange; you can spend ages trying to complete a difficult race then win the next few races by a country mile. Then again there is nothing to make you complete the races in any particular order. Another small quibble is that a lot of the races seem quite samey but these are minor concerns there is a loads of fun to be had here especially for the price of the game.,True,3
12800,"If your looking for Dirt Track racing then this game is for you.
It is massively online freeroam as well as single-player racing.

Fuel is 5560ms (ms = miles squared), 
(compared to - San Andreas: 13.6ms , Oblivion: 16ms,  WoW: 80ms, Just Cause2: 400ms, Test Drive Unlimited: 618ms)

Putting it simply, you will find it hard to simply drive from 1 side of the game map to the other side in 1 real life day.

- Game supports Xbox Live Controller for Windows. (I found that makes the game more fun to play with the feedback, compared to using the keyboard.)",True,3
12800,"Apart from Test Drive Unlimited, Burnout Paradise  and Need for Speed : Undercover, this was the only other  vehicle   based game that had open world elements  that I knew about at the time (not counting the Grand Theft Auto, Driver and Saints Row games).  What I love about this game is  the post apocalyptic feel, the graphics and physics as well as a wide selection of  vehicles, the ability to customise   them  and the  wide range of environments modelled from real satellite imagery that  you get to race through.  The  day/night cycle is a little too fast for me, but  the weather effects compensate for that.  I've often stopped just to watch a sunset or sunrise as the vista you get throughout  this game are amazing.  Not only that,  you can either  race against the AI,  your friends or just  roam freely.  You have to complete races in 3 difficulty settings to unlock new vehices and areas, that  give you access to 1000's of miles.of tracks and roads. Brilliant game!",True,3

12800,"A surprisingly relaxing, beautiful, and fun racing/exploration game. The map is HUGE. Just pick a direction and drive for hours. See that mountain looming on the horizon? You can drive to the peak if you want, but it will take a while. Just make sure you buy a good slope climbing vehicle to get you there (I suggest the Dust Grinder).

",True,2
12800,"As a racing game, you need to play this with a wheel or a controller because some vehicles have bad traction on dirt, especially off the designated racing paths. What I like about this game is that it brings back the sandbox-ish play style from the old school 4x4 off-road racing games by letting you get to checkpoints taking any path you want. Of course with the streamlined racing paths came both advantages and disadvantages. There are a lot of terrains and vehicles to choose from as you play. They even have some stuff to decorate your things lying out there for you to collect.

I can't guarantee the MP being up though.",True,2
12800,"What Fuel lacks in challenging and fair AI, it makes up for in atmosphere. It's certainly possible to simply select the races and challenges from a menu, but by exploring Fuel's vast wasteland, you find the heart of the game. Custom skins and vehicles aren't the only thing hidden throughout the landscape; there are even specific points labeled as scenic vistas. Fuel was fun because going off-road wasn't just going out of bounds - in races, it was a risk that could vault you to first or put you in last. Outside of races, there was something serene about bounding over dunes with the sunset at your back and dry, distorted guitar complementing the dirty buzz of the bike's engine.",True,2
12800,"Fuel was generally overlooked when it came out, and to be fair, there are some weaknesses in the gameplay. Nonetheless, it gives you a gigantic open world to race in unlike any other, full of beautiful sights and vast scale. For those irritated by unfair races against AI players, I recommend looking up the cheat online that allows you to use any owned vehicle in a race, no matter what classes it's supposedly limited to -- a lot of the races become a lot more, uh, possible when you do that.",True,2

12840," the best rally simulator, very realistic physics, handling",True,6
12840,"Dirt 2 is an all-purpose, fun romp of a racing game.  The game strikes a wonderful balance between *feeling* realistic and playing with the forgiveness of an arcade experience.  You can adjust the difficulty to create a greater challenge with more simulation centric nuances, but at core you're out to have fun driving fast, getting dirty, and slamming your vehicle into walls and other drivers. The handling of the vehicles is really satisfying, giving you a sense of weight and power that's very lacking in other games where driving isn't the main focus (GTA, Battlefield, etc.) and the subtleties produce big smiles when you can *feel* the differences between driving on grass vs. mud vs. asphalt and how those surfaces combine with lateral collisions as you jostle against the other competitors.  

Visually the game sparkles with appealing lighting effects and enironmental details, especially little touches like seeing your car get progressively muddier over time.  My one complaint is the excessive ""X-TREME hey-dude bring yer Mt. Dew and let's tumble!"" attitude.  The whole game is drenched with that ambiance and it gets quite tiresome, especially since you can't just skip through that nonsense to get to what's really good: the racing.

Some manage to drive with keyboard and mouse, but you'll have a tough time staying on the road.  Use an XBox 360 controller instead, or better yet, a steering wheel.  If you want something on pavement, take a look at Grid.",True,4
12840,"From the golden era of the CodeMasters racing games. DIRT 2 is an impressive game for its age.  The car handling just feels so right with excellent gamepad support and good rumble feedback.

Getting around the menus and load times can be a bit slow but the racing makes it worth it.  The ""career"" mode is extensive and the number of difficulties offered is perfect, definitely able to challenge someone of every skill level.

Not only is the gameplay top-notch, the visuals and audio are too.  There's nothing like the roar of gravel hitting your car and the dirt starting to gunk up your windscreen a couple minutes into an event.  It may not be the most realistic rally inspired game but it's very immersive.  Crashes can be intense and fun to watch in instant replay.

A must-have game for any racer.",True,4

No game plays out the same, so much variety, stunning stunning graphics, it is hard to believe this has been achieved in our life time.


Will this ever be beaten? No. Probably not. Maybe the follow up will give it a run for its money which is touted to be released if the company ever sells more than the current six copies it has sold so far.

You can lie completely motionless in a bush waiting to ambush a patrol but somehow they see you first. 

Before I continue, I wanted to say that this PC version is made by a different company then the ones who did the console GRAW2.

The missions are dull and uninteresting. The teammates were coded horribly, always making the absolute worst choices possible. They even had trouble walking  to a point 4 feet in front of them.  Even the insane AI can act retarded. I saw my teammate walk in front of a patrol who didnt even turn in his direction.

GRAW 2 promises better AI, better commands, the ability to use gun emplacements and pick up enemy weapons, multiple insertion routes, and a greater variety of weapons. It delivers most of them

The Ai is better but its still not good enough. While your squaddies don't block your line of fire nearly at all any more they are frustratingly inept at realizing when they are taking fire, or remaining stealthy, especially around corners. I often am forced to scout far ahead before allowing them to follow me. They are quite accurate as a defensive firing squad though, and they do respond to new commands quite well (they can shoot down helicopters and destroy land vehicles now).

Using Mexican gun emplacements is great in a defensive situation which is rather limited for the ghosts. As for the weapons the Mexicans drop, you'll probably never run out of ammo, but its nice to have them.

Multiple insertion routes are not really very useful and often not present in many missions. They seem like a token feature in most missions.

The game does include a huge arsenal of weapons, however unlike in graw, the interface for attachments is really awful. In graw you could see how the attachments changed the in game stats of your weapon and could better gauge how to outfit your men and self. Its an unfortunate and unnecessary tradeoff.

I hope GRAW 3 finally gets it right by keeping and improving these features, and adding to it.",True,5

IMPORTANT INFORMATION: The version on steam is the last official patch.

Roll back to the second to last version for the official release.

The reason you shouldn't buy this game is because it's supporting a terrible practice of being so incredibly lazy that you make the players patch your non-functioning game. [b] It is almost impossible to complete this game on the official steam release. [/b]",False,27

Played this game on a friends console years ago and had fond memories which is why I bought it for PC. It's very broken for both keyboard and mouse and controllers. The lighting is weird and is missing most of the shadows from what I can tell and have read in discussions. So instead of relying on shadows to hide you'll be relying on a detection meter to determine whether or not you are in the dark and hidden which really ruins stealth.  Lastly, one of my favorite parts of the game, working as a double agent was ruined due to the kbm and controller issues. I found it extremely difficult to do any sort of safe cracking in the game which made completing objectives very difficult during the hub activities and nearly impossible during one of the main campaign levels.

13580,"BUYER BEWARE: 

Its a good game that improves on the franchise. I love the roleplay elements they've introduced here which makes you feel like the decisions you make matter. 

Unfortunately, as many others have stated, this is yet another broken product being sold by the monopoly that is Steam. You could argue the game is mediocre - you can't argue that Steam is essentially commuting fraud; selling a product they say works when they know in fact, it does not. 

Also want to mention the bugs are so prevalent that the amount of time spending replaying and dealing with bugs knocks this up playtime by at least 33 percent. Bugs are prevalent at every single inch of the game. For every hour you spend playing this game, you waste at least 20 minutes dealing with bugs/crashes. Hell, I spent probably an hour trying to get the ending to play only to find out its a voice/over credits with basically no cutscene / ending. It's as if a billion dollar company ran out of money to finish the game. There must have been some MASSIVE issues with the developers/creators because this game is an absolute nightmare. It looks ok, its got a lot of good stuff going for it, but the people involved very clearly didnt have the capacity to do their jobs or were straight up negligent. As for Steam...

There's a reasonable expectation that you will encounter bugs in most if not all games, and that is an understanding all people have. What makes this so egregious is that the amount of time spent dealing with these issues and getting the game to play. The endless crashes and bugs throttle your enjoyment throughout; Simply loading a save is often a chore. You can't even get the game running without a fix. I shouldn't need third party software to get a game running from an untrusted source. If you can't sell a working product right out of the box, you're defrauding your customers, end of story.

It pales in comparison to [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/19830/Tom_Clancys_Rainbow_Six_3_Gold/]Rainbow Six 3 (Raven Shield/Athena Sword/Iron Wrath)[/url], which has all-around better design, better ambiance, better team AI, etc.  Rainbow Six 3 also has awesome mods to make your weapons have modern looking sights, scopes, cool looking gear, to improve AI, etc.  Moreover, you have tons of nice maps with Raven Shield/Athena Sword/Iron Wrath, including six classic missions and more classic maps too. 

Apart from using gadgets (flashbang/smoke etc.), the game does not consider your tactics or what you do.  Since it is totally linear and scripted, moving slowly or using silencers has no impact at all (and using a silencer forces you to use a big terrible ironsight).  For almost all objectives, here is how it works: when you cross a precise line on the floor, the enemies will open fire or open the door and flood out (I tested it many times: this is not an opinion).

In short, it is a shooting festival with about 85 terrorists each mission.  In past R6 games, the enemies had very fast reaction time: here they are terrible at aiming but there are tons of them.  

The AI for your team is sadly bad. They have pathing issues and trying to place them properly is truly annoying (too long to explain here).  After trying many times (there are 16 missions, each composed of 2 to 3 maps), I had to keep them far behind me.  I also encountered some pretty bad AI bugs, notably my team member being stuck the entire mission and one enemy that my team could not see though he was utterly 5 feet in front of us (instead of shooting, I just observed to confirm it was a bug).  And let's not talk about grenades.  

I am normally not one to complain about AI, but I can't ignore how it was functional in past R6 games, yet here is dysfunctional. How could R6 oddly become worst like this?  It feels like a cheaper version of R6. 

Imagine that Lockdown gameplay offers no in-game map: the maps are linear enough that you don't need any.  The briefings are very short descriptions. 

Replayability : there is none in Lockdown, unless you really want to redo the linear missions again.  In R6-3, there are many game modes you can play alone, tons of maps, etc.

Lockdown (2005-2006) does not even compare to the third installment (2003-2005) and it also has zero mods to make it better, though it clearly allowed mods, which shows how the community ignored it. 

[b]If you want the true Rainbow Six experience, Lockdown is really not it.[/b]

[h3]In defense of the game ...[/h3] 
That said, there was one mission that felt much more like Rainbow Six! (missions 5 on PC)  It is also noteworthy that it plays rather smoothly and I have had no crashes. 

One great feature is you can make save points !  In past R6 games, I lost hours of progress from crashes or bad luck. In Lockdown, you will die often, but you just need to save along the way.  The ideal design for a Rainbow Six game would be milestone save points. 

I will play it just as a completionist who wants to play the entire series of R6 games, and it is playable and fun in its own way.",False,1

The 1st of all. A Great story.

Summary:
Assassin's Creed is a video game developed and published by Ubisoft in 2007. The game follows the story of a man named Desmond Miles, who is kidnapped by a mysterious organization known as Abstergo Industries. Abstergo is searching for an ancient artifact called the ""Piece of Eden,"" which they believe will give them control over the human race.

Desmond is forced to use a machine called the Animus, which allows him to relive the memories of his ancestors. His ancestor, Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, was a member of a secret society called the Assassins during the Third Crusade in the late 12th century. Altaïr's mission was to eliminate nine prominent figures who were believed to be Templars, the sworn enemies of the Assassins.

As Desmond relives Altaïr's memories, he learns about the war between the Assassins and Templars, as well as the complex political and religious tensions of the time. Along the way, he discovers the truth about Abstergo's plans and becomes determined to stop them.

The game is an action-adventure game with elements of stealth and parkour. Players control Altaïr and must use his skills to navigate the game's open-world environment, climb buildings, and take down enemies. The game features a variety of weapons, including swords, throwing knives, and hidden blades, as well as various abilities like the ability to blend into crowds and eavesdrop on conversations.

Overall, Assassin's Creed is a thrilling and immersive game that blends historical fiction with science fiction and offers players a unique and exciting gameplay experience.",True,10
15100,"Ahhh. Assassin's Creed one... THE one to start an amazing franchise. 
To start off this review, im gonna talk about the open world since that is one of the best points about the game and the franchise as a whole. Because the game released back in 2007 (which was 16 years ago, holy), the game has surely aged but it didn't age like milk nor did it age like wine. It aged just fine.

The open world (for the time it released) was amazing, vast and nice to look at. You have the 5 different maps, those being Masyaf, Damascus, The Kingdom, Acre and of course Jerusalem. All the different maps had their own theme and vibe to them but i personally liked Acre and Jerusalem the most, Acre because of its imposing and threatening theme in the background and Jerusalem because of the middle-eastern vibes which i enjoyed a lot. The maps feel pretty similar to each other though minus the soundtrack and filter that they have. But the maps themselves were nicely detailed with markets being everywhere, people walking in the streets and all that. Of course, you cant compare that to nowadays AC where all of the towns and cities alone have more detail then the entirety of AC1 but that doesnt stop AC1's maps from looking amazing.

The story starts off strong with the mystery of ""what are the templars trying to find? Will Altaiir redeem himself?"" and all those questions, which they do get answered later on. But after the first few sequences, the missions get really repetitive with you having to do some missions around an area of the map, then finding out where the templar is and then assassinating him. The assassination missions were really good though and excused the repetitiveness of the game. The last few sequences is where the game starts. pick up again and gets really interesting. But i dont want to spoil too much in case someone hasn't played the game yet. 

The gameplay is also pretty average and as mentioned, it gets pretty repetitive after a while but the parkour is nonetheless satisfying (although probably the worst in the series due to its slow pace and inconsitancy) 
Unfortunately, the replayability of the game is very limited as once your done with the story, you have to go back into an earlier point of the game where you may not have unlocked certain things. There are some ""extras"" which you can do, for example finding all of the *300* flags in the game but there is no reason to find them besides getting 100% sync. You get no outfit, no weapon. no reward. But if you are a completionist like me, it will keep you entertained and it will maybe show you around parts of the map where you haven't been before. 

But thats about it, so to summ up:
I would 100% suggest playing through this game because it sets the foundation of what is going to come in the other games after AC1. You will learn how the parkour system works, the fighting (although both of these things change throughout the games) and what Assassin's Creed itself is.

A masterpiece once but for the standards of 2023, it will merely frustrate you every time you want to take it seriously.

15100,"When I started playing this game, the controller support is not good at all and the trigger buttons were not available to use which really sucks. I later did download a patch that fix the use of the controls use on console. 

I have not played the first Assassin's Creed game since 2009 when a family member recently got the PlayStation 3 with Assassin's Creed being the game he had which is also my introduction to the game that made me became a Assassin's Creed fan playing all the main game from Assassin's Creed 2, Brotherhood, Revelation, Assassin's Creed 3, Black Flag, Unity, Syndicate, Origin, Odyssey, and then currently Valhalla. Rouge is one I did not play. 

When playing the game, I like the plot from Atair being a arrogant man to a wise and target enemy to Assassinate seeing their perspective that of course show us the player see the difference of each order from the Assassin's and Templar's. The story may seem basic from having 9 target and Altair gaining back his rank to the Creed but also get to see the change development plus Desmond's story on finding what is going. 

The world is still beautiful to explore and liking the color theme on each of the locations we get to explore while also seeing how each of the situation going in and issue in their city. I also get to see how the citizen live in each location and seeing how they get struggle that can be cause on some of the main targer Altair have to kill. Doing the investigation does show how the people live base on what they converse about even if it mostly relates to the target. 

The combat is good and later get to like it more after experience how they function than when I was just a kid playing it the first time just button mashing and did not try learn more of the combat. Besides the combat, the gameplay from playing from the beginning of the game to the end of the story can be tedious due to have many repetition that repeat all the time when doing the investigation missions. I did see the repeat activity so many times but what made it still nice doing the mission despite the repetition is getting to see how the people converse and how I find the dialogue interesting. 

Story is not long but still a good game to play mostly for the plot including how Altair change to later become a great Assassin and wise that does later show more about him older in Revelation.

15100,"UM COMEÇO INTRIGANTE E MISTERIOSO PARA A FRANQUIA

Ao longo das minhas 47h de gameplay de Assassin's Creed posso dizer que tive uma experiência OK no ano de 2023. Assassin's Creed apresenta um enredo interessante, rodeado de mistérios que serão respondidos (ou não) ao decorrer da campanha. Estamos no controle de Desmond, a primeiro momento um cara comum, com nada de especial, porém, logo vemos que estamos sendo mantidos em cativeiro por uma empresa chamada Abstergo Industries, que possuem uma instalação destinada a obtenção de memórias de nossos antepassados através de um máquina denominada Animus. Durante nossas indas e vindas dentro da interface do Animus vivenciamos momentos na vida de Altaïr Ibn-LaʼAhad, um antepassado de Desmond, que é um membro da auto-denominada Irmandade dos Assassinos.

O jogo apresenta uma gameplay satisfatória para os dias atuais, porém, no porte para PC (caso deseje usar controles) será preciso instalar alguns MODS fornecidos pela comunidade. A ambientação é bem interessante mesmo que a qualidade gráfica não encha os olhos nos dias de hoje. É muito interessante o contraste que notamos entre algumas cidades dentro do 'Reino', com cidades coloridas e cheias de vida, e cidades sombrias e morbidas e tristes. No jogo podemos: correr, pular, escalar, utilizar ( espadas, facas arremessáveis, lâmina oculta, e punhos ), realizamos missões de interrogatórios, bisbilhotamos conversas, corridas, time trials de assassinato, dentre outras. No entanto, após algumas horas de campanha as missões acabam se tornando muito repetitivas, com excessão das minhas de assassinato principais que são bem interessantes e melhor elaboradas.

Porém, não só de alegria Assassin's Creed se mantém. Por algumas vezes a proposta de stealth do jogo não parece ser bem implementada na minha opinião. Os controles, limitados pela época, são um obstáculo durante as missões de assassinato, atrapalhando uma abordagem discreta e alarmando os guardas na região, resultando em uma guerra de espadas contra 17648646 guardas no final. Alguns NPCS dentro do jogo foram criados exclusivamente para dificultar a vida do jogador, exemplos deles são: mulheres pedintes de dinheiro ( o qual nem é possível doar, o que torna um completo desperdício de tempo de desenvolvimento pois as mesmas no final só se tornam inconvinientes, não chegam a ser um obstáculo de fato durante as missões), loucos do asilo/bebâdos ( esses realmente são uns FDPS, pois te empurram o tempo todo, e podem tirar o anonimato caso tente uma abordagem stealth durante missões de assassinato ). Por mais que sejam EXTREMAMENTE IRRITANTES em certos pontos da campanha, esses últimos dois tipos de NPC podem ser vistos como um grau de dificuldade no espectro de gamaplay do título.

O fator mais chamativo dentro de Assassin's Creed é, sem sombra de dúvidas, os mistérios descobertos por Desmond durante a campanha e a evolução de Altair dentro da Irmandade e como pessoa. Tendo uma mecânica de gameplay OK para os dias de hoje, um porte não tão bem feito para a Steam ( uma melhor experiência requer a instalação de MODS ) e, missões secundárias extremamente repetitivas; são o lado negativo do título. Em suma, Assassin's Creed é um título destinado para verdadeiros fãs e é um título indispensável para todos aqueles que desejam entender o enredo da franquia.

15120,"Very good game, but it shows its age in 'some' categories.

To start off, the graphics look too boxy and plain, and doesn't scream AAA, even for games in its time. While the gun sounds are actually quite good, the background audio is muddled, especially the voices. I beat the game without even properly understanding the story or what they were talking about, but the combat was so fun that I still enjoyed it throughout.

I strongly recommend playing this with a controller, because the controls feel so natural on it vs kbm. Yes there are some poor deadzone issues with the controller, but you soon get used to it. Controlling your squad mates and attaching other equipment were very intuitive on the controller. 

I just wish the game lasted longer, but I bet you're going to be interested in picking this up only at a bargain price, so can't complain much about that.

TLDR: Good gameplay, good gun sounds, but not great audio overall, bad graphics. Worth it? Very much. You don't get games like these where you control your squadmates anymore, and it was very enjoyable to do so.",True,2

15130,"you have to jump through hoops to get this thing to work properly. but once you do, it's well worth the effort. one of the greatest games in history.",True,3
15130,"There are clear references to other franchises scattered throughout the story, but the main parallel I take away is to the Jak & Daxter franchise. Everything feels like it was either inspired by or ended up inspiring different elements in the the Jak & Daxter games, from the map design and spherical collectables to the racing segments, and even [spoiler]the reveal of latent superpowers[/spoiler]. Throw in some anthropomorphic animals for good measure and you’ve got yourself a fairly generic early 2000’s action-adventure game.

So, what can you do to set yourself apart from the competition? Add a new mechanic; in this case, a camera. This is an interesting decision, and I feel this game would’ve worked quite well with stealth as a primary gameplay mechanic, but the problem is that they tried to balance these new features with everything else already present in the action-adventure genre.

It ends up feeling like there’s one too many mechanics, and as a result, there’s a certain disconnect between different gameplay elements. For example, whenever you take a photo, you get booted into a menu, which sometimes will give you tips or little bits of lore, but most of the time will just commend you and move on. This in of itself is an issue, but now combine it with the fact that you’re engaged in melee combat with 5 different robots.

You do get a power attack right at the start of the game, which’ll come in handy maybe three or four times throughout (Assuming you play like me), but outside of that, there isn’t a whole lot of depth to the combat, which is why I think it would’ve worked better as a stealth game. They do however make up for this by implementing elaborate puzzles into the core of the game (Keep this in mind, I’ll come back to it later).

The plot seems quite frantic. [spoiler]Your character is the head of what’s essentially an orphanage, which you then abandon to go be a journalist for some insurrectionist group you just decide to join after barely any convincing. Pearls are an outlawed form of currency, but everyone has access to them and you willingly accept it as payment for your missions. Pey’j says that he knew your parents and adopted you after they went AWOL 20 years ago, but that turns out to be a lie, and it’s revealed that you’re directly linked to an ancient Eldritch deity who’s been chasing you for centuries. In the end, it is coherent story, but one which is absolutely baffling and reeks of improvisation. At this point I’m just nitpicking, but I also don’t really understand the title. It has little to no relevancy with anything going on in the game, other than the general motif of morality. I could go on, but I only have a finite amount of words.[/spoiler]

With these two key points combined, the pacing of the game ends up feeling super trippy. Every level spans around two hours, and at the end of each one, you’ll feel like you’ve made barely any progress despite having completed a fifth of the game.

Now I’m gonna go into a few technical issues;

It’s pretty easy to achieve 100% completion, although there are many instances where you'll get locked out of specific areas, so if you’re not paying close attention throughout, you may permanently lose access to a collectible you’ve missed.

It is prone to bugs, but many of them can be fixed by relaunching the game. A few issues which this didn’t fix include my inputs randomly switching from toggle to hold halfway through the game (With no way of reverting it) and the camera getting stuck looking straight up or straight down during different combat segments.

Overall, Beyond Good & Evil is a muddled yet engaging action-adventure game enveloping all the spirit of the early 2000’s. It won’t ever reach the same level of popularity as something like Jak & Daxter, but I’m sure it’ll be fondly remembered by the few who’ve played it.

If you do end up buying it, you’ll likely need to fix a few bugs, but there are plenty of guides out there for that. The main reason I bring this up is because I find it absolutely hilarious that even the pictures Ubisoft chose to use on the store page are all at different resolutions. The game may be 2 decades old, but Jesus Christ Ubi, get a grip.

All that said, I’m extremely excited for the new game, not because it’ll build on the story we’ve already been given, but because it looks like a reboot that could finally give the franchise a unique sense of identity, rather than being just another action-adventure game overshadowed by more popular IP’s.",True,2

It is harmless and cute. You adopt a kitty that you can name and pick a breed and fur color for. You have to feed it, brush it, let it go to the toilet... it is much alike the Tamagotchis we loved so much as kids, just on a computer with a bit nicer graphics. You get (simple) tasks and when you complete them, you unlock new items for your cat such as hats or collars. There is no such thing as ingame stores or whatever, no cruelty of any kind.

15170,"Heroes of Might & Magic 5 on one hand is a great game, it does justice to the Might & Magic franchise and freshens up the formula a bit, but the story... oh man, the story.

Ubisoft and Nival decided to scrap the rich and beautiful lore of the previous games and now what we've got instead is an absolute disaster of a story that can only be described as an utter disappointment. The writing is laughably bad at times (as is the voice acting), the story is predictable and very generic and the whole plot overall feels like a discount store version of Heroes 3's campaign, Restoration of Erathia. It really is a shame.

As for gameplay, that is where Heroes 5 really starts to shine. 
After the very mixed reception of Heroes 4 and all the changes, Heroes 5 went back to the old formula that we all know and love with a few twists here and there. 
This right here is the main selling point of this title and the sole reason to play it. While the campaigns story is quite bad, the maps themselves are all well made and for the most part fun to play through. 
I finished the campaign after around 60 hours on hard difficulty, so there is plenty of content and challenge.

I have encountered a few issues in the campaign, though. Even with the latest patch the game still crashed a number of times in certain situations where the AI scripting wouldn't be able to finish a task and the game would either soft lock or CTD. Luckily there is a 3 slot autosave system that always ensured that I could continue playing right after.

The music is also fantastic as it was composed by the series veteran composer Paul Anthony Romero, and it's always a joy to listen to.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

But now back to the game.
The game features decent graphics, althought there is some noticible problems wich are model related, such as the MAIN ENGINE IS NOT SPINNING JUST THE PROP, and they can be kinda of a pain to get used to, another one is on the LODs, when you get at a certain distance from a plane it's supposed to lower it's model quality (in another words it will be less detailed), but they made a mistake with that, because you can see the prop just sitting there not spinning, and the 1024x1024 textures that is a so called feature is another problem, because they dont fit the hole model so they just mirror it and you can see a line on the top of the plane when you are on the ground.

But enough graphics for now, let's talk gameplay, well moving your plane is rather simple with the keyboard arrows and i absolutely love it, other people complain as its anoying and not good because it auto turns for you and becomes unrealistic, but in case you forgot this game is a arcade flight game, you see there is arcade writen on it, it's not supposed to be realistic, althought there is some things that brake reality there but i can forgive that, well there is a way just use those A and D keys and that should be covered up, unless you are in a joystick and there is nothing you can do about that other than use the keyboard, and thats why i love it so much, it feels good to fly with the it, no game i played so far felt so good, and i played alot of flight games (without counting the sims, because well they are sims you need the joystick).

The story is as bad as a plot from the new battlefield games, you just won't give a crap.

Sound design in this game is Ok not the best one i've seen, it uses the same plane sound for all of them except the jets, although i can't say the soundtrack is bad, it's great but it can get REALLY REPETITIVE, and let's not talk about the dialog in this game, it's lazy and repetitive as hell, you will loose count of how many times they will say the SAME DAMN THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN, and that's not just for the outside plot part, even in-plot they dare to use same clips from other missions, but at least Frank can be funny at moments with his lines, sometimes, just sometimes.

Oh yeah i forgot to mention the stand-alone mode wich you can play out side the main campaing, it's fun but can feel like a turkey shooting sometimes, and music there is repetitive because it's pretty much almost the same for all of them, and there is a mini-campaing that you can unlock by completing the game (good luck doing that), but it's just the same as the arcade mode but with more time and more targets and a varitaion with bomber + 2 fighter escort.

Overall Blazing angels has alot of flaws that can ruin its experience at times and can be easily forgotten by some people, it's a game that i might enjoy but its repetitive, the game gets a easy 6/10, it's Ok only problem is that it has too many issues that can kill the gameplay.

PS: yeah the review can have some repetive parts but i just wrote so people that come past this see that they can get it running on a modern OS, they just have to follow the steps said on the top of the review. And also some guides have problems by being incomplete the steps up there are simple and they are sure to work, i did those and it worked.",True,35

This was one of the first games I played on the Xbox 360 when it first came out and to this day it is still my favorite flying games.

With ""arcade"" controls you have your throtle on the left stick up and down and your pitch and roll on your right and that is the style I am most comfortable with. Other games have the controlls switched around to where I have to readjust myself to them which I really don't like to do. The game itself is awesome, the campaign isn't short and has it's challenges.

15220,"Blazing Angels is one of those turn-and-burn WW2 games from almost a decade ago. As a result, its design philosophy doesn't fit with the market in 2015. Add to that frustrating level design, uneven level of difficulty, and basically a lazy PC port, the result is an also-ran that you should avoide for more modern attempts at the same genre, such as Flying Tigers or Dogfight 1942. 

Blazing Angels postulated a special squadron called Blazing Angels that's composed of you, a mechanic-pilot, a good defender, and a good attacker, that is always where the action was in World War Two, no matter which theater of operations. You start in Dunkirk, Europe helping the Brits evacuate Europe, then fight Battle of Britain, then to Africa and joined the Brits go up against Rommel, then  jump to Pearl Harbor to fight off the Japanese, then to Midway, and Guadalcanal and Rabaul, then it's back to Europe to finish the war. 

Being launched in 2006 means the game does not support the latest input devices, but when Xbox 360 controller was released in 2005, the game's support for it was barely tolerable. While it supports all the extra buttons, the default control scheme is... sorely lacking in utility, with the RIGHT stick controlling flight. Remapping is possible but not fully supported, and there are way too many functions to map, including gear toggle. Despite HUD turned on there doesn't seem to be any speed and stall gauges available for landing, which you are required to do many times, including on a carrier, and if you overun the runway, you die. In fact, the only landing I did on the carrier, I actually ran into a parked plane and was lucky I didn't explode. 

There is no lead computing gunsight... You are expected to lead the shots yourself, nor is there a range finder. So you're pretty much shoot at enemy until they die, until you figure out how big the enemy ""caret"" outlining the craft is before you can hit it. If your craft has a rear gun the rear gunner will engage automatically, but don't expect it to really make kills quickly. The bombs / rockets regenerate after certain amount of time has passed. 

Right now I'm stuck at the Rabaul mission, which seems to be where a lot of people rage quit the game, as the previous missions are either easy enough or really challenging. Now the folks ran into a level that's f***ing impossible. Checking forums showed that retrying 50-100 times is not unusual and even the players didn't quite realize how they accomplish the misison objectives. 

Besides the machine guns, your craft may be equipped rockets (8 shots), bombs (up to 6 depending on the craft), torpedoes (1) , or even a photographic camera. And they all have their uses (torpedoes and bombs against ships, bombs and rockets against buildings and vehicles. It is not unusual to kill 30-50 planes per mission. 

Your performance after each mission is given a rating depending on number of kills, amoung of time taken, and so on. It makes for tremendous effort to be ace, and even then it requires a lot of luck. 

Graphics were state of the art back then. Now it's a bit outdated, but support for hi-res monitors are good. Sounds are... horrible, with ""Japanese"" pilots taunting American pilots in horrible Chinglish accent. At least the German accent sounds tolerable. 

All in all, I don't recommend this game with uneven difficulty level that can't be won even with cheats active. (Others spoke of trying 50-60 times). The game's outdated, with lousy control support, and is just no ""fun"" to play.",False,1

Same problem like the first iteration, ""Blazing Angels Squadrons of WWII"", this game simply will not work on other Operating System except Windows XP!

Blazing Angels 2: Secret Missions of WWII supports WINDOWS XP ONLY. I'm on Windows 8.1 Pro x64, tried to run the game normally -the option window opens up but tells me out-of-date graphics drivers- and can't recognize the running Windows. I tried to run the game in the Compatibility Mode (Windows XP SP2, SP3, Win Vista, Win 7) and still won't start.

The control of this game is uncomfortable for me, and what makes it even more uncomfortable is that I need to map the control manually to my XBOX 360 controller, which is a great deal of stress for me.

The graphics is, I can say honestly, just average. Not too good, and not too bad. But, I like the sound in this game. I really like the main background music.

I also heard that it is only available on XP. Well, luckily again, I still have Windows XP on my hand, so I can play this game without any problem. I haven't tried playing it on another OS, though.

Overall, this game can potentially become a fun experience, but the uncomfortable control and hard missions are a real turn down.

I can only recommend this game if you have Windows XP, and are an avid fan of this type of game. It's worth to include to your collection. But, for those who want real experience on this type of flight combat game, I suggest that you look for better games in the same genre.

Basically it has loads of unique setpieces, which can be fun, but usually aren't that interesting the second time around. The game is at its best when it has large airbattles and dogfights which allow the player to choose any plane and weapon loadout. Unfortunately there are only two or three such missions.

Unlike the first game, Blazing Angels 2 tries to have a storyline, which is told through filtered photos with speech bubbles like Max Payne. Most of it is really campy and not intended to be taken seriously, so it is hard to hate.

The game is actively supported by the folks over at subsim.com and there are more MODS than you'll ever need. 
The game can be manageable but enjoyable if you go for auto-targeting but the manual targeting option is a bit daunting.  I wish that it were more granular. For instance, I could see separating the task of ship recognition from the trigonometry of torpedo aiming.

15270,"[h1]COLD FEAR - You might want to read the manual.[/h1]
[b]GRAPHICS[/b]
For a 2005 PC game, are great and hold up well, helped by the widescreen patch, which makes them look better. They are just enough for what is needed for this type of video game. The color palette fits the setting and atmosphere very well, and I think its application in the game is very successful.

[b]CONTROLS[/b]
The control scheme is complex, but brilliant. You either love it or hate it. You can actively choose whether to play the game with dynamic fixed cameras in a 3D environment (like Resident Evil Code Veronica), or if you prefer to observe the environment and adopt the ""over-the-shoulder camera"" gameplay like in Resident Evil 4. The way you can flow from one mode to another is what makes it interesting; it's not a choice before starting the game, it's not an option to activate in a menu. By pressing the right mouse button, you activate the OTS aiming mode, while by default with SHIFT, Hansen will raise his weapon aiming as in a classic Resident Evil, although this last mode can limit the control you have over the aiming, since aiming with SHIFT uses a ""lock on target"" system that locks on the nearest target. Additionally, it's worth mentioning that when aiming with SHIFT, Hansen will stop walking freely and will always look in the direction in which we are aiming with the mouse. The combination of these factors will make many players end up always aiming with the right click, sacrificing completely the SHIFT aiming.

[b]ENVIRONMENT AND SETTINGS[/b]
The setting must be the game's strong point. The whaler represents a perfect mix of labyrinthine corridors, claustrophobic rooms, and unsettling corners behind which an enemy may be hiding. The rain, the rocking of the boat, the dangerous hanging hooks and crates... Everything adds up to a puzzle that is a work of art for this genre of video games and a strong point in favour of this title.

[b]VARIETY OF ENEMIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL DANGERS[/b]
The lack of variety in enemies is one of the biggest shortcomings of the game, especially considering the large number of enemies that appear in the game's concept art. Throughout the game, we only encounter six types of enemies, and some of them have limited appearances (although very well-executed). On the other hand, the lack of enemies is balanced with the appearance of environmental dangers, such as hooks and crates hanging that, upon impact will take away a significant amount of health. We will also need to watch out for the waves that hit the ship, as a well-loaded wave can violently push Hansen against the walls, seriously injuring him. We also need to watch our steps on the whaler, which, rocked by the waves, can make us slide and crash hard against walls, or in worse cases, send us overboard. To avoid becoming victims to the waves and gravity, Hansen must grab onto anything he can with the appropriate button, which will hold him in place and prevent him from sliding. In addition to ""natural"" dangers, we will need to watch our step because we will encounter traps and tricky situations, such as a room full of explosives and the ease of detonating them while defending ourselves. I won't go into detail to respect the reader's gaming experience.

[b]STORY[/b]
The story is rather generic, with notable flaws and plot holes that are hard to ignore if we pay even minimal attention. In the first 10 minutes of gameplay, we see a paramilitary team boarding an apparently abandoned whaling ship to investigate something, and they are suddenly surprised and defeated by unknown creatures. Then our hero comes into action with his own team to investigate what happened. His team is also eliminated, leaving him alone to investigate the area, putting us now in his shoes aboard the whaling ship. As we progress in the first 10 minutes of gameplay, we discover that it is not a whaling ship, but a cover for a Russian scientific-military operation.

Speaking without spoilers: One of the most notable flaws in the game's story is that some details that are important and key during the first half of the game have not been explored, explained, or sustained towards the end of the game. A certain character, suddenly disappears without really closing their role in the game, leaving a gap in the final segment that leaves a strange taste in mouth. Also another matter of vital importance is completely ignored towards the end.

As I write this and think, I have realized that one of the possible causes of these incoherencies in the narration may be a sudden change in the script towards the end of the game.

[b]CHARACTERS[/b]
Unfortunately, the characters are generally flat and one-dimensional. But what is most notable is that the villains introduced in the game, as quickly as they appear, are just as quickly forgotten, with forgettable performances. They lack real depth or presence in the game, and their appearances are almost exclusively limited to written documents or death scenes that coincide with their first appearance in flesh and bone. Hansen, has a hint of depth that is exposed to the player in a conversation, but it is soon forgotten and completely abandoned by the game's narrative, limiting this depth to two sentences that, if not read in the manual, leave the player bewildered as to what they could possibly mean.

[b]GENERAL GAMEPLAY:[/b]
The ship setting seems very fitting for this type of game, with a strong sense of isolation and desperation, coupled with the swaying of the ship, which makes it difficult to aim at enemies' heads. The game never provides a map to consult, so players must find their way by paying attention to character conversations or reading the documents they come across. This is by design, as to locate ourselves on the ship, we must read signs that are only translated by Hansen when we aim directly at one. I believe this choice was well made, forcing the player to locate resources and objectives more realistically and not allowing us to rely on a magical map that constantly indicates our location, something I have been guilty of relying on in many games before, and thus initially surprised me. As mentioned above, the controls allow us to choose between two modes of play at any time, allowing us to play the game as we please. This has been a very interesting and entertaining experience for me, sometimes forcing myself to avoid the use of one camera or another. Exploring environments in one mode and then in the other, and seeing the constant changes in perspective, may be disconcerting for some players, but it has been very fun for me.

[b]READ THE DAMN MANUAL (Included in steam):[/b]
From describing actions, to giving backstory to enumerating dangers, the player will benefit greatly from reading the manual. Among other things, it contains a map that the game never shows at any time or place.

[b]REPLAYABILITY:[/b]
There are no unlockables beyond the concept arts in the main menu and the higher dificulty. I have not found an extra weapon, an alternative look or whatever. This is quite sad in a Survival Horror game where replayability is often a must.

[b]CONCLUSION:[/b]
Cold Fear is a survival horror title from the early 2000s that has aged decently graphically. The story is what we can expect from a title from that era, with typical genre cliches and a few difficult-to-ignore plot holes, but these do not detract from the gameplay experience. The limited variety of enemies, while not excusable, is balanced by the environmental hazards that we must navigate. The Spanish translation is mediocre, and the dubbing is the same. The setting and gameplay experience, tied to the controls and atmosphere obtained from the environment in which the events unfold, are, in my opinion, the strong point of this title, allowing us to forgive all the flaws in favor of a fun adventure where scares and nerves abound. The final boss, on the highest difficulty level, is an absolute son of a ****.",True,5

Ghost Recon is a tactical shooter game based on a military approach where players need to implement few tactics with the team to complete objectives. In terms of game play there are limited weapon load out options for each player in the team to customize based on the mission requirement.Enemy AI is pretty accurate in terms of gun play and movement and when they get alerted they might respond back based on player movements and tactics.

Graphics and rendering in the island thunder(Second expansion) are more detailed than the previous two parts.Plot is decent and similar in both the expansions excluding the added in game content and few new features.

15300,"I was feeling nostalgic for Jungle Storm, but Jungle Storm isn’t on Steam, so here I am.

If you have a small group who’s willing to play with you, this is probably a solid investment. If you’re going in solo, adapting to the playstyle may be a little awkward. The game combines RTS and FPS mechanics, which you’ll need to switch between quite frequently during solo campaigns, but you’ll soon find that it’s a legitimately well-made shooter which successfully incorporates elements of both genres. If you’re looking for something a bit different, you’ve come to the right place.

The AI can be a little clunky at times. Bots won’t move when engaged in combat, so if they spot an enemy through a wall, you need to either kill the enemy or take control of them manually to get them going again. Likewise, if they get stuck in a doorway or on a bush/tree, they will to be unable to execute any orders whatsoever until manually moved.

It’s also got a few issues on modern-day hardware. Any attempt to leave a mission, be it by extraction or abortion, will result in the game window being hidden. The same goes for loading into a mission. Both of these issues can be remedied by spamming left-click so the game window stays engaged, but you do end up missing cutscenes as a result.

The storepage kinda lies to you when it advertises 23 singleplayer missions. The campaign is fifteen missions, with a one special mission in a separate gamemode and eight tutorials (All of which are on the same map). Aside from those few issues, it’s a good game.",True,1

When you buy this game play atleast 6 campains before you decide to stop since the first 3/4 campains have a lot of explanation about the game and it goes pretty slow without a lot of fighting against big armies.

Heritage of Kings is a strategy game that plays in the middle ages.

The game tells you the story about the caracter called Dario, as he attempts to regain his land and regains his rightly trone. As a lost prince of the campain story he has to prove to the settlers that he is a good prince by defeating the evil forces. In addition to the spearman, archers, swordsman, calvery and cannoners he can recruit , he can also have company from certain heros later on in the game. Dario, Pilgrim, Salim, Erec, Ari, and Helias all have special ability's where they can fight with one can call bandits the other one can throw down bombs or even heal people etc.

You start up a campain with atleast 1 hero and 4 serfs. The serfs can build and repair buildings or can mine anc cut down threes you also have the option to give them weapons to defind your castle when you do not have enough troops.
There are 5 resources in the game wood,clay,stone,iron and sulfur there is also a currency.
Aside from wood to gain resourses you have to build mines on top of a deposit. Now you have new settlers working for you, you also have to build a place for them to eat and sleep else they will leave your village. You can also research in a college so you can upgrade your buildings and make new buildings where you for example create a army.

15390,"This game is lightyears better than both of its two predecessors (Road to Hill 30 and Earned in Blood) in almost every way. 

For one the story/subplot is far more fleshed out and entertaining (both in substance and in comedy/drama).  There now exists a cover system that makes the ""suppress and flank"" mechanic feel more fluid. The overly unrealistic ADS inaccuracy that prevented you from being able to kill enemies even at an extremely close range is no longer present. Regardless if you are using the 3rd person crosshair while in cover or the 1st person sights while ADS, you can now more naturally and accurately engage enemies. Grenades now have a far more realistic blast radius and an aiming reticule now exists to show you where it's going to land.

15400,"Well, now you've gone and done it. You've made a remarkably unique Tower Defense game, and that takes some serious effort these days, along with a whole lot of crazy.

Harvest: Massive Encounter is honestly just that: a TD game. If you like TD games, you're going to enjoy it.

So what makes it so unique compared to the others out there on the market, from the starcraft 2 maps to flash games?

First off, resource harvesting. You get nothing for killing enemy units; you're dumped into the middle of an endless field full of minerals. Your job is to mine as many minerals as possible, and survive as long as you can. (With some variations on a theme for different game modes).

The map starts out small, but if you build towards the edge of any one side, it'll stretch out, expanding the minimap further and letting you move farther away from your base. As such, you have pretty much unlimited room to build, but the most dense packs of minerals will be close to where you start off, and the farther from your central base you get, the less efficient mining will become.

The towers provided to you are remarkably few in number for a tower defense game, but they're very carefully fine tuned to be exactly what you need. For example, laser towers have relatively short range themselves, but can be set to focus all of the laser towers in an area to a single, massive beam. This effect can scale to an unlimited degree, and you can chain smaller groups of laser towers together to form an enormous, intricate network of lasers that has immense range and godlike firepower, or break off their power temporarily to wipe out a swarm of smaller enemies that are faster.

You can set your towers to prioritize, deprioritize, or ignore certain enemy types as well, so it's well within your power to tell little lasers to focus fire kill the suicide-bomber style gehenna shuttles, but ignore some of the larger units, while having your eagle class missle launchers ignore the shuttles unless they're the only thing left on the screen, or ignore them entirely, only aiming for bigger game to hunt.

Another really unique feature to H:ME is the energy system. I've seriously seen nothing remotely similar to it in any game before or since. The idea is that you build solar power generators, which create a ball of energy every few seconds. The energy ball bounces randomly between any adjacent point that it can possibly reach, until it comes across something that needs power, and then it rams the target and provides the power required, disappearing from your screen in so doing. This quickly leads to a vast, intricate network of energy lines going all over your base, and energy management becomes vitally important. Having a ton of energy on one side of your base, but not the spot that it's needed, is BAD. Fortunately, you have plenty of very easy to use tools to control your energy flow, such as marking a building as top priority to get any and all energy it needs, or drawing out routing paths to force energy balls to travel along a set path, only being allowed to follow their typical AI programming when they exit the path.

Pretty much everything in H:ME can be summed up this way: it's weird, but in a really good way. It's creative, unique, and it WORKS. It's not just different for the sake of being different, but rather, it's different because it makes the game more interesting and fun.

It'll take awhile to get used to most of the unique aspects that Harvest has to offer, but they're well worth the enjoyment once they've grown on you a bit.



Final Verdict:

Everything Harvest: Massive Encounter does, it does well. The learning curve is really quite steep, however, there's no plot, no multiplayer, and it's really just one big tower defense sandbox. For what it strives to be, it's pretty much perfect at. For what it doesn't try to be, however, it doesn't do at all. If you don't like TD games, this won't be the one to make you a convert, by any means, but it'll be one of the best TD games you've played if you do like them.


Score: About 70%. It does what it does pretty much perfectly, but it completely lacks a few areas that could make it a lot better still.",True,58
15400,"☺ A different twist on Tower Defence.
☺ Heavy on strategy.
☺ Solid mechanics.

☹ Limited diversity.
☹ Repetitive.

Harvest: Massive Encounter is appropriately named. It's up to you to defend yourself against large waves of enemies that attack from all sides rather than predefined routes as you harvest a finite amount of resources and build up your defences, enabling you to expand your territory to harvest yet more resources and defend against even larger and deadlier waves of enemies.

Unlike a lot of tower defence games, Harvest: Massive Encounter is all about the known variables and a synergy of mechanics. You require resources to build Harvesters, Solar Plants, Laser Towers, Missile Turrets and Link Nodes - no endless stream of unlockable buildings here, just the tools for the job! The Solar Plants produce the power you need to operate the harvesters and fire your turrets and everything needs to be connected via link nodes to allow for a smooth transfer of energy, should a link in the chain break or your layout bottlenecks your supply, you'll be looking at an even tougher fight to survive. It's a very clever mechanic that rewards thoughtful placement and allows you to steadily expand without being constrained to build only area's or a grid system.

It's all about keeping the synergy between your assets allowing you to expand, collect, defend and repeat. For added complexity, Laser Towers can be linked to produce a more powerful beam with a longer range, so it's not just about putting more towers down to stop the flow of enemies, it's also about creating strong defensive points to tackle the harder enemies (of which there are several types with varying strengths, such as speed or the ability to teleport in reinforcements).

It's a tough battle from the start until you're inevitably overwhelmed, victory is not so much about defeating your enemy but simply lasting as long as you can before your defences finally cave in. Maybe you'll fair better on the field, but it'll be tough as thousands of enemy ships close in.

This may all sound rather positive but unfortunately, because the game relies on such closely knit mechanics there isn't that much diversity in what you can do or the enemies you face, its simply about using those limited tools you're given to the best of your abilities. You're also limited to the one, barren map until you can unlock another two after putting quite a few hours into the game and while there are a few game modes available, they offer a similar experience.

While a solid strategy game and a unique tower defence title, I'd only really recommend the game for those patient few that like a challenge, enjoy refining their tactics and can feel a sense of accomplishment in beating their old records. While the game can be satisfying and very rewarding when you defeat a wave with all your turrets still intact, for those looking for a greater sense of progression or some light hearted fun, I feel the game could quickly become repetitive.

With tough acchievements to keep challenging you, this unique Tower Defense might have you yelling at the sceen, or even going out of your way to destroy any spinning yellow disc-like objects. I've found myself getting into the 'one more run' mentality about it on more than one occasion. 

The only issues I have with the game are that there are only 3 planets (lack of scenary options), and I find at times linking/unlinking towers can be needlessly complicated, especially when I'm trying to get very specific owers to link, unless theres a shortcut command like shift+click that i've been missing all these years.

-You play as a black hole sucking up smaller objects to become bigger
-Lots of different objects

-Climbing ramps is a chore, and why can i climb over some objects and not others that are smaller or same size?

Bleh!

-Some items are too difficult to assume they are able to be sucked up next
- Scoring high grades depends on best route memorization method
-No real replay value after seeing everything

The Lowdown:

You play as something that must steal all objects smaller then yourself to get bigger, so you can take in bigger objects before the time runs out. The game is nice for quick 5 or 10 minute runs at a time, but lacks anymore depth to long lasting. Your guy turns like a truck, which can make it difficult to get up some objects, or those real narrow ramps up to upper levels. The graphics while I am not crazy about fit the style quite well, for its cartoony element. There are 12 levels that take place in many different areas that are very spacious, with tons of objects to suck up into yourself.

With the main objective is to find smaller objects then yourself to get bigger, this can be difficult at times as some objects that look smaller won't register as being one that you need.

Once you complete all the levels, you can go back into them and try to best your score, or try some endless modes but I did not find any real appeal in this, but for top score nuts it will.

There are 2 levels that are troublesome due to collision issues but once you get the hang of  them there are optimal routes you can take so that’s not an issue (you can get stuck between tables or if you go under a surface you can end up getting stuck due to increasing your size while under it for example).

15500,"     As a long time fan of the Katamari, The Wonderful End of the World looked right up my alley. Even though the game was HEAVILY inspired by Katamari, The Wonderful End of the World lacks everything that makes the Katamri franchise so great. The gameplay is very bare bones. All you have at your disposal are the arrow keys (or wasd/equivalent) or a gamepads directional control. There are no camera controls and no jumping despite playing as a bipedal character. 
 
     At it's core, the game does what it sets out to do. You start each level as a vaguely humanoid figures made of a floating orbs (like an emaciated Vector Man) who becomes bigger and more fleshed out as he rams into items around the stage and sucks them up. However, there doesn't seem to be any indication of a size goal for each level which is a nuisance when you're trying to achieve an A+ rating in each level. The game also make much effort to indicate how close you are to being able to pick larger objects up. This leads to a lot of running into an object that seems to be the same size or smaller than you and either boucning off of it, (sometimes into multiple other objects too large to pick up, creating a pinball effect) or passing right through it. 

    The music ranges from kind of terrible to ""I guess this is alright"" but it very rarely seems to fit the motif of the stage you're in and most of the stage music seems to be loops that you end up hearing several time over through the course of your stuff absorbing. I feel the same way about the game's art as well. It's pretty hit or miss and never particularly great.

Lets avoid those broken bones by not falling face first into a building, and remembering you have a parachute on your back.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1] 

Gotta stay close to those objects to get the hugs and kisses! A parachuting/base jumping game where you fall from high heights like the daredevil you are, avoiding buildings yet kind of sticking close to them for points until you hit the ground for points. You can do stunts and daring  falls – the idea behind it is pretty entertaining and stomach dropping if you've ever had the experience yourself of parachuting, since you can feel the buildings rushing past. The response in the game for your character is good, and the visuals are not hard to follow. There's nothing like flashy neon lights as your character plunges to their potential death because they really like jumping off high buildings.

The controls are not adjustable which is bad for me as I use an azerty keyboard, the game is awkward to play smoothly like this. The settings are inflexible. I wouldn't mind an option to be able to change the controls to what I want.  

Also the moment the game gets harder, I think it would be better to play it with a controller, rather than a keyboard. I don't like the layout of the pre game screens too much, though that's just down to personal taste. I think it looks a bit cluttered with the numerous squares/spinning squares, but the playable part of the game is addictive, plunging down those heights and trying not to accidentally splat myself on a building. I have to say I wasn't sure if I would like this, so I'm pleasantly surprised how addictive it is.

I find the terminology/language of the game amusing. “Mash face against mountain.” “Collect teeth.” “No broken bones?” “You aren't dead! That's grand!” Small, witty one liners make me happy on the inside, I admit it. It's hard to play but rewarding for your progress. A game doesn't need to look amazing or be complex to be good. And there seems to be a lot of game time available,  and a lot of levels. I wouldn't keep playing it  continuously for hours, but I'm more than happy to go back to it and play it in-between other games, or for half an hour or so at a time. It's fast paced and lets you get stuck in almost straight away.

What I find annoying is how far back a level/save point resets if you die, which can mean you have to refight tough monsters you already killed, and repeat a lot of content, which could make it stressful fast. Though there is a sense of achievement getting past those ANNOYING OBSTACLES.

[b]Pros[/b]

Lots of game time/content to get through
Good price
Witty one liners
Addictive 

[b]Cons[/b]

No adjustable settings/controls for a movement based game

Pre game layout isn't so attractive

TL;DR

[h1]Overall Verdict[/h1]

I think it's worth the buy and play, as long as it's in a bundle or sale. There's enough here to keep you going for a while when you're bored with your other games.

15560,"Ever look over the edge of a tall building and hear that voice in the back of your head tell you ""... jump...""?

This game seems like it's entire concept was constructed from that very principle, often called ""Lapelle Du Vide"" or ""Call of the void"" though with a comical twist to the whole idea. The goal is simple, jump from a VERY high altitude (some go as far as space), come close enough to buildings and objects that you ""kiss"" or ""hug"" them without suffering the ill effects of free-fall collision, and try to land safely. BTW, instead of earning coins or something, the main currency you use to unlock new levels is ""teeth""... I don't know why but it makes me just uneasy enough that I laugh every time I finish a level and it sais ""You've earned X number of teeth!""

15700,"I was torn on whether to give Abe's Oddysee a thumbs up or thumbs down because neither really feels fitting.
Ultimately decided to go with a thumbs down because I think the best part of the game is everything [i]other than the gameplay[/i], which in turn just isn't enjoyable.
When I'd sooner recommend a friend to watch someone else play it than to play it himself, there is a problem.

Let's get into the details though, as there is a lot to criticize. 

The visual design, music, sound effects, alien atmosphere - all magnificent.
Gameplay though, as I read someone else describe it: a [i]sloppy[/i] game that expects YOU to be perfect.
Save system is stupid, controls sometimes aren't responsive or bug out in the worst possible moment, so even if you [i]are[/i] in fact perfect, every now and then you're forced to bite the bullet and overdo a section because game rng decided to just not cooperate and a single error usually means starting again from the last savepoint.

The modokons you save are drooling idiots. I'll forgive them not being smart enough to jump or roll, but they always require a ""hello! -> follow me!"", which by itself is fine, but there are sections where time (and timing) is REALLY of the essence. And in the middle of it a modokon is likely to stop following you because he had to stand still for three seconds and he'd rather literally die than wait more than that. Thanks friend.

The difficulty is all over the place, too. Halfway point felt like a tempting moment to drop the game. I figured that if it's been this rage-inducing up to this point, I can only imagine what awaits onwards.
But as it turned out, the second half of the game was overall [i]easier[/i], less rich in artificial difficulty, felt more consistent, gave more feedback on your progress, and was oddly swimming in grenades which often could provide alternative solutions to problems. It also had no secret areas, which are generally the hardest part of the game, because 1) you have to find them in the first place, 2) they tend to be the most unfair sections and 3) there often isn't a savepoint after them, so even on success you end up replaying them a lot.
And for some reason, all of them were shoved into the first half of the game? Bizarre.

Hardest section of the game is arguably the second quarter, after you [spoiler]escape Rupture Farms and before you return to it. Particularly the wildlife trials you're being put through by your tribe to prepare for rescuing modokans from the evil meat plant. Makes me think that you know guys, this could have been much easier and less prone to failure if instead of putting me trough the tests you'd just let me handle the rescuing uninterrupted.[/spoiler]

[b]+[/b] atmospheric
[b]-[/b] jank savepoint system from hell
[b]-[/b] questionable responsiveness of controls and movement
[b]-[/b] difficulty that more often than not feels artificial and not ""fair""

[b]EDIT:[/b]
To elaborate on my gripe with the save system, and what makes me call it jank,

when you get past a savepoint, there's a visual indication that it was in fact savepoint, and you usually notice it, but it's subtle enough that sometimes in the heat of things you might miss it and be unsure if the last save was a moment ago, or a long time ago. There is manual saving, but the way it works it reloads you to the last successful savepoint.

The best way to describe how it's jank is to imagine savepoints are one-time use. After that, a savepoint spot is inactive, and only becomes active again if you traverse to a later/earlier savepoint - then that previously inactive savepoint spot becomes active again if you go back to it. Consequentially, it causes a lot of annoying backtracking back-and-forth between savepoints just to be sure progress is saved.
It didn't work like that 100% of the time for whatever reason, but the best way to make it work consistently for you is to assume that's the case.

Problem is, some sections do not [i]have[/i] more than 1 savepoint, so it basically forces you to complete a few sequences perfectly with no way to save progress in between because if you die, you have to redo the whole series of sequences again. Some of the hardest hidden areas liked to be placed in the middle of those.

It wasn't consistent though, in the sense that those multiple-sequences-per-savepoint weren't reserved for the later areas, and if anything most (if not all) of them were present in the first half of the game. Feels like the savepoint [i]system[/i] and savepoint [i]placement[/i] was designed by two different people, and they never talked to each other.",False,1

15950,"Reaxxion is a pretty standard 'Breakout' game, nothing you probably haven't seen before. It's not a bad game, it's actually pretty fun but there are at least 2 reasons why you probably do not want to buy this game:

1. It's unplayable on Windows 10 and Windows 8.1 

2. The price: 10,- is way too much. 

",False,10
15950,"I only played this for a little bit before I had to stop, which is unfortunate, as it has some nice elements to it.

This game has your standard breakout/arkanoid mechanics - move the paddle, bounce the ball back and forth until all the blocks are broken.  What's a little different with this the ball comes out of your liquid metal reserve in your paddle, meaning the length of the paddle is directly proportional to how many balls you have left.    When you run out of liquid metal, you lose a life.  There are also three different sizes of balls you can have in play, which change how many bricks you can break before the ball will bounce.  As you break the blocks, drops of liquid metal drop down and, if you catch them, they cause your paddle to grow.  Catch too much without using it (you can have multiple balls in play), and the paddle will start ejecting the liquid metal all over the place.

...I'm probably making this sound a lot dirtier than it is, but I don't really know how else to describe this without getting really silly.

Anyway, the game has power ups, all of them deal with how the ball destroys the bricks.  Some make you punch through them in a line, others take out a large group at once, others shoot off electricity and hit others randomly.  Their usefulness can be situational.  Finally, there is an area on the stage that, if you get three of your balls into it (it doesn't need to be all in one stage; they seem to carry over), you can create a REAXXION, meaning the balls turn from silver to gold, go from three to five, grow in size, and then shoot out everywhere.

Anyway, while all of that sounds neat (and indeed, it is pretty neat), it has some flaws which made the game unplayable for me.  If you're playing in windowed mode, it doesn't take much for the mouse to travel out of window, causing the paddle to stop moving.  And if you're playing full screen... it still kind of seem to do that.  The other problem is the paddle seemed to stutter quite a bit, which is aggravating when you're trying to bounce the ball back.

Each place you visit involves a number of hidden object scenes, finding things that are lying around, and using tools in mostly obvious (and sometimes extremely unlikely) places. Occasionally there's a mild puzzle to solve, such as solitaire, match 3, jigsaw puzzles etc. It's all very easy, the cartoony style makes the objects stand out quite clearly, although in each scene there's usually one or two objects that are hidden a little better than the others.

The actual game has a simple aim - keep crossing the DNA of fish until you find seven particular breeds. However, it's embedded into quite an entertaiing aquatics shop simulator, the aim of which is really 'collect all the things'.

I had prepared an extensive list on everything wrong about this game, but feeling so shty after beating it, I find myself without the energy required even to write this ultra negative review. So I'll summarize it - A LOT - below and even leave somethings out to make this as short as f'ing possible.

Shooting has no recoil, but rather cone of fire, even when ADS. There's mouse acceleration. Shotgun is RNG. Sound is too low. You have to configure mouse DPI and buttons 4 and 5 on your mouse software. Killing enemies is unsatisfactory. The game is too dark for no reason and flashlight is trash. There's hit marker now. Some enemies on hard difficulty will instantly hit-kill you so you'll spend the majority of your play time reloading the auto-save and just trying to cheese that specific enemy who is scripted to do that. And if you choose to play on normal difficulty to escape that, the game becames insanely easy. The pacing of this game is f'ing garbage and devs thought it was a good idea to spread countless notes throughout the game so you'd stop to read it and waste even more of your time and break the momentum that is constantly interrupted.

The only good thing about this game was how it looked from inside the mech and walking through the city in rubbles, making me wonder how good a Terminator game with that atmosphere would be.",False,1
16450,"[h1] Not as strong a recommendation as the original F.E.A.R. [/h1]
I would only recommend getting this at a discount, for reference I completed both the main game and the DLC on Hard.

It is fun most of the time, as far as difficulty in this game goes it just means you die quicker, quite often instantly.
When I did instantly die I had no idea what killed me a good half the time. was I snuck up on? was some random thing near me explosive and a stray enemy shot blew it up? did the enemy headshot me? is that even a thing? 
I more often than not was stuck thinking what could I have possibly done rather than how do I approach this better, as there was generally only one place to fight from and alot of the time whenever I died it would turn into memory game rather than actually testing my skills, as in many situations when I was dying I simply had to kill certain enemies within a very short time of them appearing.
This was a particular problem with the sniper enemies as they will take out all of your armour with the first shot and all of your health with the next, and when they join the fight you get ~1/2 a second of laser to see where they are before they shoot and then like a second or 2 before they peek out for their next shot and if you didn't get their exact location on the first shot you likely wont get them before they finish you off.

My favourite gun from the previous game, the shotgun, was quite disappointing this time around, as it had become a generic video game shotgun with almost no range and a lot of spread, it still occasionally turns enemies into red mist and gore but FAR less then in F.E.A.R. (and only at point blank range whereas in the the original game you could do it from a few meters away), with those changes I rarely found myself using it.
The next best gun from the previous games, in my opinion, the Penetrator was replaced this time around by the near identical Hammerhead which only differed in being quite inaccurate at mid to long range (which was it's main purpose in my playthoughs of the previous game, and it's expansions, as with it's high damage but low rate of fire it maintained accuracy when fired in full auto making it great for picking off anything not in shotgun range) when fired from a stationary position and aiming down the sights at a range of ~10m, if not less, it would deviate atleast a heads width from the red dot making it pointless to try using it at range.
[spoiler] Though when the aforementioned sniper enemy is introduced you are also introduced to their bolt action sniper rifle which works wonders at range, as you might expect (though ammunition is only available when enemy snipers are present meaning that you won't be able to use it too often) [/spoiler]

There were a few points where the difficulty seemed simply unfair, there were 2 in the main game and 1 one in the DLC where, atleast on hard, the fights were set up in a way where there were so many enemies that popping your head out of cover often just had you instantly die, due to like 5 enemies all shooting the nanosecond you did, but otherwise there weren't any points where there was a difficulty spike that felt completely unfair.
[spoiler] 2 of which were solved by essentially cheesing the fight by going far enough away to where the enemies basically couldn't hit me and using the sniper until they stopped coming [/spoiler]

The endings, gameplay wise, of both the main game and dlc are rather disappointing as they both consist of a short fight, where you will more or less instantly die if you don't constantly use the slowmo. This is something I had to learn the hard way on the main game as I never really used the slowmo (especially in combat) so it didn't even occur to me and I had to look up how to get past the final fight.",True,1
16450,"F.E.A.R. 2 is a horror first-person shooter that delivers a heart-pumping experience with its immersive atmosphere and intense combat sequences. The game's AI system still stands out as one of the best in the genre, creating dynamic and unpredictable encounters that keep players on the edge of their seats.

One of the strengths of F.E.A.R. 2 is its storytelling, which effectively builds upon the narrative of the first game while introducing new and intriguing elements. The game's graphics and sound design are also noteworthy, contributing to the overall sense of unease and dread.

The game offers a variety of weapons and abilities, allowing players to tailor their playstyle to their preferences. The multiplayer mode is a welcome addition, providing an additional layer of replayability to an already engaging single-player campaign.

Well, technically, Fettel wants to eliminate Alma so the mission is once more for the greater good and by joining Paxton we go rogue so the game still requires us to eliminate dozens of replica soldiers.

Unfortunately, Reborn is extremely short. Some of the locales are great and we get to enter a mech once more which is pretty cool but overall the game is very short. At this point 8 euros is too much for it and it does not really add anything interesting to the story.

Some of the achievements are interesting and hard to get (they go by the name ""awards"" and can be accessed from the main menu instead of using the Steam achievement system) and all in all the game offers a nice challenge for FEAR veterans.

More often than not, developers try to cash in by selling unnecessary additions to games in the vein of aesthetics or shoddy maps for a deserted multiplayer. Monolith is at least deserving of praise for creating a piece of downloadable content (arguably) worth acquiring.

Reborn puts you in the boots of a Replica Soldier (the enemies you fight in F.E.A.R.). As expected, you are no ordinary soldier. You are coaxed into partaking in a dangerous mission by the voice of Paxton Fettel (the series' antagonist).

Gameplay remains largely the same with bullet time being the main gimmick. This short campaign serves as a segue for Fattel's return in F.E.A.R. 3, adding some coherency to the franchise. While it isn't a must-buy, Reborn's presence is certainly appreciated.

I usually do not cover a separate review for DLCs and expansions but I made an exception with F.E.A.R Reborn because I loved it! It’s a very fun dlc. It’s only an hour long (you could finish it in less than 45 minutes if you’re very good!) and despite the short length I’m not disappointed. I’ve enjoyed it more than the base game and it’s rare to have such great fun with expansion. Reborn has a bigger focus on action and the pacing is very fast yet doesn’t feel rushed. If you’re expecting this to be Perseus Mandate and Extraction Point like experience then you’re going to be terribly disappointed with short length and heavy focus on action.

You play as a replicant soldier this time around. Things go even wilder and supernatural in the background with an apocalyptic and destructive chaos. The story is very straightforward and very silly. It doesn’t mean the story is bad in any shape or form because it’s story surprisingly works effectively well. Minos spoilers ahead!! They brought back Paxton Fettel from the first game and yes, he is alive, reasons unknown? You’re controlled by him and your mission is simple. Set Fettel free…. that’s it! Reborn delivers a tense final battle and a true climax that will have you pining for a sequel, which is in pleasant contrast to F.E.A.R. 2's final WTF?? moment, which probably left me more confused and disappointed. With Reborn It seemed like they were trying to set a foundation for Fear 3. 

Although the developers resorted to reused assets from the main game, I expected them to just recycle the same environments and locations and the good news is that they didn’t!!  It’s not very perfect though. I’m not a hundred percent sure about this but enemy A.I seemed to be slightly toned down and acted a lot dumber. Graphics also looked worse especially in cutscenes and background. There aren’t any new enemy types so you’ll still be fighting the same Armacham’s soldiers, feral creatures, ghosts, mini bosses and assassins. Reborn lacks the tense creepy atmosphere from the Project Origins. It also doesn't provide any real creep-outs or scary scenes. 

In spite of some minor setbacks, I got more than what I expected. The dlc retains the same gameplay from F.E.A.R 2 with minor touches here and there. The short story provides a more gratifying bridge to the sequel and I think that’s cool!

16500,"This is one of the worst puzzle games I’ve ever played. I don’t even know where to start.

So the object of the game is to wait for some colored dots to spawn, then click on a variety of stationary tools to get them to fly into receptor objects. Sometimes the dots will fly wildly all over the screen until you activate magnets to suck them up. Other times they will break or decay and need to re-spawn. Yet other times they don’t respawn, so if you mess up the puzzle you need to start all over. There are a few good ideas, but what game doesn’t have a few good ideas? Here, it’s completely destroyed by a large number of issues:

* Non-deterministic physics. When I first played the game, the introductory level told me to “just watch.” Then physics glitched out and two particles collided when they should not have, breaking the level and leaving me staring at the screen until I realized I had to restart. Things didn’t get much better from there.

* Most of the puzzles don’t involve planning, but having highly precise aim and timing. This is “I know what I need to do, but it’s taking me two hundred tries to do it: the game” 

* Solved the puzzle? – Great, now you have to do it again. Four times. For some reason, clearing most stages requires you to repeat the exact same actions several times in a row, usually four times, sometimes more. All the while, the physics could glitch out at any time and require a restart.

* The only texture in the game is the space background. White textureless models are hard on the eyes and make it difficult to distinguish between different objects.

* Twitch-reaction solutions are very frustrating when they require quickly clicking on multiple tiny objects.

* Camera controls are a joke; the camera and the game can’t be controlled at the same time, and it resets at the beginning of every level.

* The only music is a few 12-second ambient loops. Sounds are unremarkable. (The voice-overs for the tutorials were decent, though)

* It is impossible to play this game in full-screen if you have multiple monitors, it will crash instantly. You need to edit a config file just to let it run.

Could have been up there with the Trials games.

It appears like the devs have lazily ported an app version of this game to the PC.

When booting the game, a config page is displayed, but selecting my resolution of 2560 x 1440 meant that all textures in the game were so garbled and messy I had no idea what was being said/displayed.

I read a fix for this which says to start the game at a low res like 1024 x 768, then use the in game resolution changer (NOT the 1st config page) to set the correct resolution. But, the textures don't seem to be optimised for higher resolutions like 2560 x 1440. The clunky way of clicking through every screen resolution before hitting the right one is quite annoying ... was it really too much like hard work to add a drop down selector?!

Not made for PC. Should be sold very cheap to reflect its value to the PC gamers.

See screenshot for textures issue - the textures display fine at low resolutions:

We're playing on PC, so we can mod the game. We can mod it even without any extra downloads. There are guides for doing this. 
-We can change sneak speed.
-Damage dealt/recieved.
-Increase gun clip amounts. (I recommend set to 5 for StG 44)
-disguise effectiveness.

Alot of other reviews make points that I never experienced. I didn't have any problems with enemies noticing my silent kills in other rooms. Shadows worked as they were supposed to through most of the game, though missions with all dark environments (night and foggy) throw away her invisibility like she regularly is through most of the game. In such cases, be very watchful of her visibility icon. 
I didn't have problems with enemy conversations holding up the game. Lure them with a whistle, then hide, then backstab them. 
For myself, the story is nonexistent. 

Some ways I find the game to be bad are it doesn't have basic things that much older games have. There's no New Game Plus (NG+). Even after you beat the game, there's no mission select. Changing outfits/skins for Violette on any level should have existed.

16730,"I have plenty of important games I need to play, but somehow I found myself back here messing around with Legendary.  I don't know why, but this game has always intrigued me.  Long ago, I made a gameplay video as part of my August 2015 Farewell Extravaganza:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaSdgkJ2-5E

That was the last time I played, until a couple weeks ago I got the urge to try it again and see if it was possible to play in virtual reality with vorpX.  Good news: it works well!  I was able to make a custom profile that makes it look almost flawless in full VR.  (Nothing I could do about the giant gun model.)

Even though the visuals are incredibly outdated and haven't aged well, the game is a massive spectacle.  Feeling like being ""inside"" of this chaotic mayhem is really something else.  Finally, I was able to complete Legendary - and I played it entirely in virtual reality.

The game is from a different era.  It's a corridor shooter and has basic combat mechanics, without any RPG systems that are now tacked-on to almost every game in almost every genre.  This means it can feel monotonous to play Legendary, but the basic shooting was satisfying enough to entertain me through the brief campaign.

Another game that has fascinated me for a very long time is The Darkness II.  I should be playing a serious shooter game in my list of games to play, namely Shadow Warrior 3.  But maybe I take another quick diversion to see if I can have success getting TD2 to run in VR?

[b]Story:[/b] Mesopotamia has definitely seen it's own fair share of battle and conquests, from Babylon, to Alexander the Great of Greece, to battles between the Romans and the Parthians. Even to this very day there's still battle in this part of the world, I'm not going to get political, but none can deny the historical significance of this geographic map.

[b]Gameplay:[/b] Most of this map is land-based; so plan accordingly. I've always been partial to making a fortified country on a collection of islands far from my annoying neighbors and their loud music... nope, can't really do that here.

[b]Achievements:[/b] There are no steam achievements tied to this DLC.

[b]Price:[/b] Civilization V: Cradle of Civilization – Mesopotamia is priced at $2.99, To buy the whole collection of Cradle of Civilization – DLC Bundle the price is $9.99, lastly (and best option for DLC) is Sid Meier's Civilization V: Complete Edition for $49.99.
I personally picked up my DLC from a humblebundle, but in the end if you like DLC go for the big pack, you'll save more in the long run, then individually purchasing each DLC over time. 

[b]Conclusion:[/b] The DLC does exactly what it's advertised to do. If you have the money, and think “man, I'd like to play a civilization V game in a real life location”, go for it. If you're a little tight on the financial side, you probably should skip this DLC since there are pleanty of player-made-free-Civ5 maps.

16867,"This review is for the Spain & Inca Civ/Scenario Pack DLC only. Familiarity with the base game is assumed. You already have this DLC if you bought the ""Complete Edition."" The DLC offers good additional content but the store page could be a lot clearer about what you're getting, hence this explanation.

This DLC adds the following content to the base game: 

* The Spanish Civilization
* The Inca Civilization
* The Conquest of the New World Scenario (original version)

It is important to understand that this DLC was made somewhat redundant when the Gods and Kings expansion was released, and if you have G&K, you may not want to buy this separately, because: 1) the Spanish civ is also added in G&K, and 2) there is a modified scenario called ""Conquest of the New World Deluxe"" which utilizes G&K content, and is available as a free download. In other words, if you already have G&K, what you are getting with this DLC is the Inca civ and the original version of the CotNW scenario. Now you know.

Regarding content: 

As with every other civ, the Spanish and Inca have special units and abilities. The Spanish, lead by Queen Isabella, have more powerful mid-game units - the tercio and conquistador (replacing the musketman and knight, respectively) - and a unique ability that rewards settling near natural wonders. The Inca, lead by Pachacuti Inca, have a more nimble early archer unit called a slinger, and bonuses related to hills, incuding a better farm and faster movement. The civs themselves are well developed and enjoyable to play.

The Conquest of the New World scenario is really well designed. You play either a European or Native American civ beginning in the year 1492. Unlike the base game, you win by accumlating victory points during a 100-turn challenge. The Europeans (Spain, France, and England) race from Europe towards an undiscovered western continent. The Native Americans (Iroquois, Aztec, and Inca) are already there and vie for dominance against each other and the new arrivals. The ""New World"" continent is randomly generated during every game, which keeps things fresh and, IMHO, maintains the spirit of exploration and discovery even if it does give up geographic fidelity. As such, the scenario has high replay value.

This DLC adds some great content, but be aware that you might not want to buy it separately when it is available in the Complete Edition and, in large part, in the G&K expansion too.

The Double Civilization and Scenario Pack: Spain and Inca will add the Spain and Inca civilizations to your game, and additionally add “The Conquest of the New World Scenario” (Original version... An updated version was free with the Brave new World expansion pack).

[u][b]-Detailed breakdown review-[/b][/u]
[b]Story:[/b] There's no real change to the story with the addition of Spain and the Inca Civilizations. However you could consider “The Conquest of the New World Scenario” as an addition to the “story”.
If you don't know; Scenarios are single player 'campaigns' which are designed to put the player into unique circumstances which would probably not be encountered in a regular game.

In the Conquest of the New World Scenario victory is given to the first civilization to reach score 1,000 or to the civilization with the highest score after 100 turns. There are two geographical starting areas, if you play as a Native American you start somewhere on the American continent. If you play as a European nation, you start with a well developed capital city and try to expand into the Americas.
Additional rules to consider: you cannot declare war on other European nations until you research Piracy, your ships will all have the “Scurvy promotion”, which may take away 1 HP for every turn outside of friendly territory.

There are different ways to earn points, Sending Caravels to China will earn 200 for first, 100 for second, and 50 for third. Additionally collecting Treasures and delivering them to a capital city earns points, and there are two natural wonders which generate treasure.

[b]Gameplay:[/b] There are two new Civilizations with this expansion: Spain and the Inca. Both play very differently.
Spain's geared towards exploration and settling on natural wonders to get culture and happiness. The special units are the Tercio (which replaces the Musketman unit) and the Conquistador (whom replaces the Knight unit), The Conquistador is one of the best scouting units in Civilization 5, not only can the Conquistador move far, it can also found cities on other continents.
The Inca are geared towards food and production, but are particularly strong when on hills. The special tile improvement for the Inca civilization is “Terrace farm” which allows you to build a farm on hills, this helps to increase how fast Inca cities grow because of increased food supplies. The special unit for the Inca or the Slingers (which replace the archer unit), and the final note worthy perks are that Units ignore terrain costs when moving into any tile with hills, and no maintenance cost for improvement to hills.
[i](just a personal side-note here, Isabella is a pompous noble and we shouldn't be kept in the same room because one of us will be provoked into invading because of insults to ones sense of honor. Although I guess I didn't play nice with the other kids in general so maybe that's more my own fault?)[/i]

[b]Achievements:[/b] There are a fair amount of achievements for the scenario, and there are victory achievements for winning as either the Incan or Spanish Civilizations, and lastly there are a few special condition achievements, my favorite being: “Nobody expects...” which is earned by using a Spanish Inquisitor to remove another religion.

[b]Price:[/b] The Double Civilization and Scenario Pack: Spain and Inca is priced at $7.49. and the Sid Meier's Civilization V: Complete Edition is priced at $49.99. I keep saying: “If you like the DLC and want to add more to the game, your best bet is to purchase some type of bundle deal.

[b]Conclusion:[/b] This is one of the better DLC bundles, however it complicates things since a lot of this content was doubled up thanks to the Expansions... so this could be a skip anyway... If you want DLC get the Gods and Kings, and Brave new world expansions, much better quality products then these little addons.
If you have the money, go for it. But if not I'd suggest waiting for a sale or purchasing some type of bundle, be it the Complete Edition, or maybe Humblebundle.com will run another Civilization bundle.

Here's the URL to see my review for [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/8930/]Civilization V[/url]",True,25
16867,"Review of both civs:

Inca

Inca is a civilization that leans mainly towards a Science Victory, but has a very mild advantage in a Diplomatic and Domination Victories.

Their Unique Ability is Great Andean Road: All units have double movement in Hills (Stacks with other bonuses, such as Mt. Kilimanjaro or from other units, also costs only 1 movement point when crossing hills with Forest/Jungle), giving you a slight advantage in a domination victory, and roads cost no maintenance in Hills, and half the cost on solid terrain (though with the Wagon Trains social policy from Commerce, you don't need to pay any maintenance whatsoever for roads and railroads, which can help you to get a Diplomatic Victory, since it's essentially an Economic Victory).

Their Unique Unit is the Slinger,  which replaces the Archer.

It has 20% less combat strength, but it has a withdraw ability (if you get attacked by a melee unit, you withdraw and take no damage) and it stays on upgrade, so it's recommended to get some to upgrade them, since Composite/Crossbowmen are very powerful units.

Their Unique Improvements are Terrace Farms, which can be only built on hills, and provide 1 food, + 1 food for every adjacent mountain, which stacks (along with other bonuses, including Petra and rivers), and it's possible to create some very powerful tiles with these farms, if placed near mountains with rivers, and possibly Petra, if you have built it. 
(If you, by some chance, get a Worker on a desert hill tile, workable by city which has Petra, and has a river, and is fully surrounded by mountains, it will yield 9 food and 2 production, the 2nd most yielding food tile, beaten only by Spanish Lake Victoria, which i'll be covering later).

Recommended map type: Highlands

Now, for Spain.

Spain is probably the most Hit-or-Miss civilization in the entire game. They are dependent on a good start, and finding wonders. They're an exploration-based civ, with UA promoting it, and one of the UU's supporting it.

They can go for basically any victory type, thought their most recommended ones are Domination or Culture, depending on which wonders you get.

Their UA is Seven Cities of Gold.

You get a gold bonus for discovering wonders (500 if you discover it first, 100 if you discover it after another civ has found it)

Happiness from discovering wonders is doubled.

Yields from wonders are doubled. That includes Happiness, Food, Production, Gold, Culture, Science and Faith (Natural Heritage Sites and One with Nature pantheon included, meaning you should pick that for your pantheon, because if you have a NW you're basically guaranteed to get a religion with it). The bonuses for units from Kilimanjaro and Fountain of Youth don't double.

Their first Unique Unit is the Conquistador, which replaces the Knight.

It's a very neat Unique Unit, because it can found a city on another continent that doesn't have your capital, meaning it's worth it to build these and explore with them), but they also get a bonus for sight (4 sight from 2), don't have a penalty for attacking cities, and double embarkment defense, meaning this unit is very good for mid-game exploration. It's more expensive to upgrade to and build, but it's cheaper to upgrade it.

Their second Unique Unit is the Tercio, which replaces the Musketman.

First of all, Tercio is a melee, not gunpowder unit, meaning it gets the 15% production from the Warrior Code social policy, and   the 25% bonus Impis have against gunpowder units doesn't affect Tercios.

They have increased strength (24 -> 26), cheaper upgrade cost, and 50% bonus against mounted units, making these essentially a better Pikeman. But they're more expensive to make/buy than the Musketman.

Spain's UA should decide what kind of victory they are going for, i'm gonna cover some wonders here, along with preferred victory type.

El Dorado: Preferred victory type - Culture

It yields 10 Culture from start, but with NHS it yields 20 culture, and with a Hotel, Airport and National Visitor Centre, it yields 40 tourism, which is really good.

Fountain of Youth: Preferred Victory Type - Free choice (though it helps get Dom Victory due to the bonus)

It yields 20 happiness. You shouldn't have too much happiness issues (unless your cities are growing very fast, and you're low on luxes)

Cerro Del Potosi: Preferred victory type - Diplomatic

Though it gives a rather small bonus compared to trade ship yields (only 20 gold), it can help you get a diplomatic victory, but it will definitely help keep your empire have a good economy.

Great Barrier Reef: Preferred Victory Type - Free choice 

It's a very flexible wonder, due to that it gives multiple yields, and if you settle near it, and get the One With Nature pantheon, you get 16 faith. But with NHS, Hotel, Airport and NVC it gives 40 tourism, which really helps you get a tourism victory. If you settle near that wonder, then you've got a really good start, and if you manage to get One With Nature, religion is guaranteed.

King Solomon's Mines: Preferred Victory Type - Domination

The 12 production is very beneficial to a Domination Victory, it helps with early wonders or making your UU's.

Krakatoa: Preferred Victory Type - Science

It's Science yield is measly in the later game, but earlier it's a Korean Academy, meaning if you settle near it you don't even need to build an academy, and it gives a neat science yield. However it's frequently unworkable, due to it being very far away.

Lake Victoria: Preferred Victory Type - Science

The 12 Food gives a very good head start to a city, and if you settle near it, you're set for life. In TSL maps, it's near Mt. Kilimanjaro, which is very neat.

Mt. Sinai: Preferred Victory Type - Free Choice

16 Faith on start. 24 with One With Nature. You get this, you have a religion that is unstoppable. 

Uluru, Sri Pada, other faith wonders - Free Choice

Honorable Mention 1: Rock of Gibraltar

You start right next to this wonder in TSL earth maps, which is really good, it has a nice gold/food yield too.

Honorable Mention 2: Mt. Kilimanjaro

Gives nice food and culture bonuses, gives units a buff for movement on hills, and is next to Lake Victoria in TSL maps.

The other wonders are not worth covering at all, because they usually give out bad yields and are not worth to settle. 

Overall, these civs are good, as long as conditions are favorable.

Thanks for taking your time to read this review!",True,9
16867,"This here is the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/recommended/8930?snr=1_5_9__402]Civilization V[/url] - Civ and Scenario Double Pack: Spain and Inca, which gives you two civs and a scenario. It's okay for what it is.


Spain is a civ that benefits the absolute most from natural wonders...assuming they're lucky enough to find and exploit them. They also get two powerful Renaissance military units that let them expand into new worlds, and their war music is some of the best in the game. Pity their AI is usually content to be a grumpy, piety-loving city-state.

The Incans are probably the more powerful civ; not that Spain is weak, but the Inca are ultimately better. Their UU is good for its time, their UA lets them defend well/travel efficiently through hills, and their UB boosts them to top science levels by providing mountains of food on hills next to mountains.

Growth = science because growth = population and population = science, and because growth is the end-all resource in Civ, the Inca are somewhat more flexible than other choice science civs. Really, they're not too far from Poland territory - Poland being the most overpowered civ in the game.

Pachacuti's amusing in his arrogance, too...except when he invades you.


The included scenario is about the colonization of the New World, and it's pretty okay - worth playing at least once or twice. An updated version was released for free for the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/recommended/235580/]Brave New World[/url] expansion, and Spain was reincluded as a civ in Gods and Kings.

The original scenario uses vanilla Civ gameplay - 10 HP combat, no religion, imbalanced policies, etc. The scenario achievements are for the original version [i]only[/i], not for the Deluxe version. Playing as England in the vanilla scenario will count for the 'Ruler of the Seas' achievement, if you decide to use your navy. Also, the New World is randomized, which adds a lot of replayability. Unfortunately for balance concerns, Spain and the Inca are really the choice civs - but after all, it [i]is[/i] kind of their scenario.


Overall this would be one of the better valued DLCs for Civ V if most of the content wasn't re-released for free. If you somehow do not own the complete pack, I'd still pick this up for the Inca.",True,5

16868,"This is the Babylonian Civilization DLC for [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/recommended/8930]Civilization V[/url], which adds a highly powerful science turtle civ, apart from [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/recommended/99612/]that other one[/url].

Babylon focuses on science generation, as evidenced by its unique abilities:

* Receive free Great Scientist when you discover Writing
* Earn Great Scientists 50% faster

Babylon's science focus is geared towards having an early science advantage, which players must leverage going into the late game. These bonuses are more technical than Korea's (Korea being that other science civ) since you must earn and manage their Great Scientists efficiently - but that earlier science advantage can help you out, because science counts for a [i]lot[/i] in Civilization. Just make sure you use your first free Great Scientist to build an Academy and you're off to a good start - in the right hands, Babylon is even more ridiculous than Korea.

Their unique unit and unique building are both available in the Ancient era, and both help defend fabled Babylon from aggressors. The Bowmen can be used to go on the offensive if you really need to - with less units than if you relied on Warriors/Archers - and the Walls of Babylon have utility throughout the entire game.

Babylon's aesthetic is pretty great, and for me it's a close winner over Korea's. Their AI behavior, or I should say Nebuchadnezzar II's, is usually kind of crazy. He's ornery and will likely build tall, although in my experience he can do this with a lot of cities in a small space as opposed to picking Tradition policies and only settling a handful. Attacking him can prove a headache with his uniques and his tech advantage. Nebuchadnezzar II was historically mentally ill for a duration of his reign, which goes a way towards explaining the leader scenes.

I'd recommend this for players who want to, in the words of one r/civ user, 's**t science and S**T Great Scientists'. You only get Babylon with this purchase, though - wait for a sale to get better value.

And don't spawn next to Assyria. That will only end in pain.",True,77
16868,"[u][b]-Quick Review-[/b][/u]
Babylon is a Scientific Nation, so their strong suit is to progressing scientifically, additionally they have particularly strong defensive units and buildings early on in the game.

[u][b]-Detailed breakdown review-[/b][/u]
[b]Story:[/b] There's no direct change to the “story” with this DLC. Unless you end up meeting three men named “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego”, pro-tip; they're fireproof. Oh, and you might want to make Daniel one of your advisers, he's a wise-guy, and quite good with cats. [i](High-five if you understand my humor!)[/i]

[b]Gameplay:[/b] Babylon is what you might call a “Defensive Scientific nation”, as you progress scientifically you build defensive units to keep your nation safe while you strive ahead of the competition by use of a free great scientist when you discover writing.
The Unique Unit to Babylon is the “Bowman”, the Bowman replaces the Archer. The Bowman is stronger then the Archer in offense and defense, in combination with the Walls of Babylon you have yourself a formidable defense.
The unique building to the Babylon nation is the “Walls of Babylon”, the Walls of Babylon replace the standard walls, Babylon walls provide more defense to a city, increase a city's HP, and even require less production to construct.
The last two features to talk about are the special abilities this nation has: Free great Scientist when you discover writing. [i](does there need to be any more explanation then that? Get all the science.)[/i] and you earn Great Scientists 50% faster.

[b]Achievements:[/b] There is at least one achievement requiring the Babylon civilization: “By the Water of Babylon” which requires a victory on any difficulty playing as Nebuchadnezzar II.

[b]Price:[/b] Sid Meier's Civilization V: Babylon (Nebuchadnezzar II) is priced at $4.99. I picked up my DLC off a humblebundle deal, I suggest grabbing all the DLC in the Sig Meier's Civilization V: Complete Edition for $49.99. Standalone it's a bit expensive, on sale it's ideal for your Civilization gaming experience.

[b]Conclusion:[/b]  All in all, this was one of the nations I enjoyed playing the most! Although, it does feel weird to launch a space ship from Babylon city... but that's just one of the charming facets that Civilization V provide us.

This ain't your run-of-the-mill FPS. No, sir! This is a hardcore milsim game that'll make you feel like you're really out there dodging bullets and taking names. And with all the customization options, you can kit out your character with more gear than an army surplus store.

But here's the thing that really caught my attention: the attention to detail is off the charts. It's like the developers sat down and said, ""Let's make this game so realistic, the players will need a training manual just to get started."". Well, maybe not that realistic but I like to look at it like a little simplified Tarkov with multiple game modes and no risk to the gear,

And let's not forget the multiplayer. It's like a game of chess, but with guns and explosions. You'll need strategy, teamwork, and a whole lot of luck if you want to come out on top. But when you do, you'll feel like you just won the Super Bowl.

Well, let me tell you, when you're crawling through the mud with your buddies, trying not to get shot in the face, there's a certain camaraderie that develops.

I'd like to say I actually stopped playing Tribes for a long while. I heard they were updating it again, ignored it. Tried playing it again this January. I have a few words as a tl;dr I'll post here in the beginning and elaborate further down.

tl;dr: ""What the fuck was Hi-Rez thinking? This game is a fucking dying corpse of what it was!""

Now let me elaborate. I'll start with some immediate key changes to the game that I personally do not understand why they changed.

[h1]The Classes[/h1]

God just... what the fuck were they even doing. This isn't neccessarily a 100% bad change but it's not good either.

Before this game was changed a lot, you had three basic classes, each had three sub-classes of it. You have the light, medium, and heavy. For light you had the Pathfinder, the Sentinel, and the Infiltrator. Medium you had the Soldier, Raider, and Technician. Heavy the Juggernaut, Doombringer, and Brute. Each of these had their own specific set of weapons with a degree of loadout customization. To add to that there was this perk system which while it had it's own issues, is definitely better than what we have now.

After the update, it was stripped down to ""Light"", ""Medium"", and ""Heavy"", all with their own loadout slots. The classes of before are all a legend of the past at this point. You could choose ""Light"", and give it any weapon & ability combo you want, which is one of the major downfalls of this game now. It removed the barrier between classes, or at the least severely lowered the gap. For reference, a Pathfinder trying to fight any of the heavy classes. It was possible to win this situation as the Pathfinder, but it would require concentration and the ability to out-maneuver the enemy. To any of the players playing post-update, they shall know that pitting a light against a heavy is a lot more ""even balanced"", in that the light class, if set up right, can easily dispatch a heavy when played correctly.

This is one of the things that really set this game's base floor, was that the classes used to actually be different in ways more than just movement speed & health/energy. You could argue that weapons are still class-restricted in that only the heavies can get heavy variants of the weapon, sure. However that doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things when a light class player could just give themselves a bunch of explosives, or design a class loadout specifically for taking out heavies.

[h1]Bases. You know where this is going.[/h1]

What the fuck was the decision making in this part? Seriously?

Base upgrading has been outright removed from the game entirely. Turrets, Generators, Sensors. Nothing can be upgraded anymore. In fact the credit system was removed entirely. This pretty much makes playing technician exceptionally stale & boring. I have no inspiration to sit around my generator room for the entire goddamn match with an enhanced repair gun just to repair a generator stuck at level 1 for eternity every 30 seconds it gets taken down by a rush, because our turrets are level 1 and even the worlds fattest heavy class can just ski right past them. I really don't have much more to say about this. It's a bad feature removal and should be brought back.

[h1]Removal of the credits system[/h1]

As mentioned above, the credit system has been removed. From what I've tried, the call-in system just doesn't work anymore, even though you can still equip the call-in markers, which no longer have a display or show how much they used to cost. Of course this doubles in with the removal of base upgrading.

[h1]Weapon (de)balancing[/h1]

Bullet guns have been turned into pepper spray. The shotguns may as well be literally shooting pepper spray canisters. Other weapons have actually received buffs and assorted miscellaneous changes, with other special variants also being introduced. Most of the new variants I personally think might have an interesting change on the gameplay, if only the gameplay of Tribes: Ascend was still the way it was. So unfortunately, they don't really do too much.

Weapons have had inane changes to their stats that feel out of place, and alienate me from wanting to continue playing this game. Just the same as the developers did eliminate some of the weapons from the game that no longer exist.

[h1]Closing notes[/h1]

I cannot recommend anyone this game in it's current state. It feels like they picked up a game they abandoned at one point, said they'd update it some more, and then just tweaked a whole bunch of stuff to see how the community would react and then never change it back.

Also another huge negative from what I'm seeing in some other reviews and discussions, apparently people can no longer register to play Tribes: Ascend. So if you already have an account on this game, lucky you. You get to play it. Were you reading reviews to consider playing this game? Well sorry but you're out of luck. Even if you install the game, you apparently can't make an account from what I've read. If anyone can prove those dozens of claims wrong, by all means go ahead.

17120,"This is a game you are meant to spend as much time as possible with, souly on one map, to achieve anything.  You need to have several spare tombs for your pharoh as well as he can die suddenyl without warning (I had one pharoh die two years after his father died and didn't have a tomb ready because of it).  You need to establish the school, then healthcare, funeral and temple buildings quickly (I do it in this order as the school is basically the first thing you need to get more graduates to power all other buildings that require them).  You need a large low class population established by the time you reach a point where no more villagers are on the map to milk people from.  I tend to build all 4 types of buildings farms, labourers, soliders and servents for this reason even if I don't need them.  

If you don't have more then half your population as low class, you may find slowly over time your Low class population disappears, and as their population works the entire city... You can easily end up with an econimic crisis on your hand as there won't be enough Low guys to fuel the class descent systme from low to high society.  So you have to make sure tyour middle class populance never goes above more then half the size of the lower.  Likewise, at no point should your high class guys take over more then 1/4 or 1/5 of the population of middle. 

Also despite the games advice that you must locate buildings close to the source of raw materials they use, you can really put them anywhere on the map.  Only a few will greatly be impacted by this when they can get to a template or healthcare building in time.  Some buildings like shops can use the exchange, saving the need to worry where in the city they are placed.  For others like perfume makers who gather their sources, honestly, they get their resources from 4 possible sources so they may spent days walking all over the map making careful placement almost impossible.  

Other then this... Building as many small tombs as possible keeps the nobles happy as they need tombs as well as pharoh an there are no consquences if a royal family member dies (not pharoh) so you can forget about supply them with tombs (unless they are pharoh).  Brick layers and brick makers can more or less be placed anywhere on the map. They are essential tot he city, but by the time you have two dozen of them, most projects are then catered for forever.  You don't tend to need more then that because monuments tend to end up require large stones such as stele by the point you have a dozen or so brick makers working. 

Collecting taxes are almost not worth the cost of having an overseer... Especially in large cities where they will almost never be able to see every estate.  And tariffs are even worst as you can sometimes not get more then chicken feed. So I tend to ignore these.  If you have more then ample farms, pulling back some of the nobles food for the sake of the poor is not a worry and honestly?  The nobles numbers support the city via farms, loosing them means the city collaspses (it happened to me once).  It best they are allowed to keep as much food as possible even if the citixens of the city suffer becase of it. 

The current version of the game, however, is buggy.  Back in the day I never had any troubles with the game, thus, I can almost 100% put this down to modern OS.  The most it lasts for me is 2 hours.  As I said, this is an issue as you are meant to spend a day per mapat times...

This isn't Cities Skylies where buildings magically appear from nothing and your people only exist when they're outside of their homes and even then they don't matter because they're not actually doing anything.

In CotN, your little people exist (and matter) at all times. So, how about an example? A simple one. Say you just had a bit of a building spree and now you have so more government workers to feed, right? Well, this is ancient Egypt and food is currency. So, you need a bakery to produce the bread that you're going to pay your workers with. You find a convenient spot for it and place down the starting plot. Now again, this isn't Skylines or SimCity, this bakery isn't going to magically fall out of the sky prebuilt and staffed and shitting out bread on day one. Your people need to build it. And they need to produce and gather the resources to build it. In this case they need bricks.

So, to start with you need the bricks themselves, right? So you have a brickmaker. And this brickmaker needs clay and rushes to make bricks. But, don't worry he'll go out on his own to gather it all and start making bricks. After a while you have a nice stash of bricks, but they're still in storage and they're not in the form of a bakery. Ok, so you need a bricklayer. Easy enough. These hardworking fellas will haul bricks from brickmakers or brickyards to your construction sites and when they've moved them all they'll start building. A bakery isn't too fancy (we wanted a simple example, remember?) so your bricklayers will have that bakery completed within a year (one day/night cycle in game is a year btw).

Alright, so now we have a bakery! Except it's not popping out loafs of bread. Why is that? Well, we need a baker obviously. Now the good thing about bakers is that they don't require any education or training. Baking in ancient Egypt wasn't exactly very complicated after all. So, all we need is a worker from a lower or equal class (or their grown children sitting at home) to move on up in the world and take over the bakery.

In this case let's say one of your overworked farmers has moved in. Alright, so we have a baker. Perfect! We're done, right? Wait... Why isn't he making bread? Well, because, yet again, this isn't a modern city builder where everything is simulated so nothing matters. Your baker is an actual simulated person. And this person, just like you, wants things. Like a bed (a mat in this case), some pottery, and so on. And his new bakery is severely lacking in all of that. So he, (or if you're lucky his wife) will go shopping. And yes, all of those goods need to be produced by your craftsmen/women as well. So, that first pottery store that our baker stopped off at was sold out and now he's going to go check the other pottery story over by the papyrus makers to see if they have any pottery.

And then, finally, he's at the bakery. The wheat and barley from your fields is being baked by him into bread. He's got your lettuce and onions ready to handout alongside the bread to your other workers.

So, I know all of this sounds excessive. How can you possibly keep track of all of this? Well, you don't have to. All you need to do is make sure that you're keeping an eye on stocks and production chains and placing down whatever worker/building is lacking. Your brickmaker will mold and bake bricks on his own. Your bricklayer will haul and build on his own. And your baker is equally just as hands off.

But, what is impressive here is that all of this actually happens in CotN. It's not simulated. You can watch it all happen. You can watch your brickmaker wander out down by the river in search of rushes and clay. You can watch your scribe checking the fields for taxes. You can watch your priest tend to the shrines and apothecary before heading over the schoolhouse. And that pyramid that you're building? Yeah, you can watch that being built. Block by block. From the quarry, up the ramps, before being placed and then finally shaped. There aren't any ""circles of effectiveness"" for various service buildings. The people can either fit in a trip to that building today in their schedule or they can't.

It's all there. And it is magnificent. Maybe, one day, we'll get a modern game that follows in these 'unsimulated' footsteps. But, it's been a long time at this point and I don't think any of us can hold our breath any longer. It's just not happening.

Which means that CotN is still, in late 2020, the best city builder to date.",True,5

17140,"This game was a disappointment, and it weighed on me doubly so because it's based on an idea I love.

Hinterland is one-part Diablo-style action game, and one-part village-management. Essentially, you go around a randomly-generated map, fighting monsters and trying to find resources to sustain a village. At the same time, you're recruiting villagers to your humble land who can then set up shop as tailors or blacksmiths or guards. These villagers, regardless of profession, can also be armed with gear and set up to defend their village during monster raids or adventure with the player in a party.

However, it is [b]SUCH[/b] a shallow experience. The graphics are visibly of bargain-basement quality (as you can see from the screenshots). Combat devolves to pointing and clicking, then watching your adventuring party (you can only ever control one) beat up whatever is in the area. Worst of all, the village you build up becomes supremely underwhelming when everything it produces are far outshone by loot from the wilderness. The loot itself is never visually appealing or causes satisfying effects beyond making damage numbers higher.

Personally, I have always wanted a game village that takes an active part in the player's game. After all, has a NPC farmer ever asked you to kill 5 rats? Haven't you ever wanted him to kill his own damn rats? You have pitchforks! You have hammers! Fight with me against the enemy hordes!

i never played crysis multiplayer or online, i just played crysis 1 and it's remastered version.
i gave crysis 1 7.5/10, the remastered 8/10. since multiplayer is more fun than singleplayer i give this game :
7.5 + 0.5 = 8 since it is not remastered, if you launch the game you will see a 1 minute cinematic of how fun this game could have been if i played it when it came out, which i did not, lol
if you really want to play there are community made servers with around 10 or 12 people online.

Mirror's Edge is a game that truly pushes the boundaries of what a first-person action game can achieve. Released on PC in 2009, it was praised for its immersive atmosphere, vast vertical and horizontal spaces, fluid game dynamics, and natural camera mechanics that follow the character's movements.

One of the standout features of Mirror's Edge is its unique art style, which creates a clean and minimalist world with vibrant colors that make the game world feel alive. The game's visual design also includes some truly breathtaking environments that range from soaring skyscrapers to the gritty underbelly of the city, all of which are brought to life with impressive attention to detail.

The gameplay in Mirror's Edge is equally impressive, with a focus on free-running and parkour-style movement that allows players to navigate their environment in exciting and fluid ways. The game's control scheme is intuitive and easy to pick up, but mastering the various moves and techniques takes skill and practice. The level design is also top-notch, offering a wide range of challenges that require both quick reflexes and strategic thinking.

The camera mechanics in Mirror's Edge are also noteworthy, as they add to the game's immersive feel by following the character's movements in a natural way that makes the player feel like they are truly a part of the action. Whether running along walls, sliding under obstacles, or leaping across chasms, the camera always manages to keep up with the player, providing a seamless and immersive experience.

Overall, Mirror's Edge is an outstanding game that deserves all the praise it has received. From its immersive atmosphere and stunning visual design to its fluid gameplay and natural camera mechanics, it is a game that truly pushes the boundaries of what a first-person action game can achieve. If you're looking for a thrilling and immersive gaming experience, look no further than Mirror's Edge.",True,3
17410,"I like fast platformers, I loved Ghostrunner (Although short) And Titanfall 2 remains among my favourite games of all time. So I thought I’d give Mirror’s Edge a try.

I can see the fun that can be had with this game, running around and jumping from roof to roof. Sadly, the game is adamant about not letting you do this fun bit, instead being bogged down with frankly terrible combat, nigh unavoidable sniper fire, annoying indoor-climbing sequences, pace killers like climbing up poles, or shimmying along edges. All of this combined just created frustration, especially the combat.

The story is also very bland, but this would not have bothered me and wouldn’t be worth mentioning if I enjoyed the rest of the game.

The visuals of the game are very nice, the art direction quite good for most of the game. Although I think the cutscenes looked very uninteresting.

There are just better alternatives to this kind of game out there that manage to keep that platforming flow going. I wish I could enjoy this game but couldn’t.

17450," [h3]Dragon Age: Origins[/h3]

is by far one of the best Fantasy RPGs from Bioware. Better described as one of Bioware’s Best.
In typical old fashion, the Player will be lead through a giant and very detailed Gameworld to explore, to interact and to experience Adventures while making decisions that affect various Elements and the Outcome of the Story.

Right at the beginning there is a choice to be made that also has an effect on how the Game will start and how the Player Character gets treated during the Playthrough and furthermore, which Skills a Player can obtain by leveling up after earning EXP in a lot of Combats against Hords of Enemies.
And to fight them, the Game also offers Companions to recruit, to equip, to command during the Adventures and to have dialogues with to learn more about them and their Backstories.

The Game’s absolute strength is definitely on how well it delivers on the Roleplay department and while it surely has a Main-Story the Player has to follow it is still up to them on how to handle the Situation and to be who they want to be. To build their own Character instead of having to *help a specific Person* on their Journey.
Also the Combat is a huge Plus for it to let Players control an entire Team of Companions, but also to set them up so they can act on their own as well if preferred.
And also to mention the huge Fantasy-World that is filled with lots of Story-Elements to explore.

Sadly there are also some weak Spots to mention for this Game and in Dragon Age’s Case its the Moments where the Main-Story has Points of no Return that aren’t so well pointed out during the Adventure. What sometimes can leave the bitter Taste of having to revert back to an older Safe to complete Side-Quests that otherwise would have gone lost.
Also there are some Balancing-Problems with specific Areas and Enemies from Time to Time that can lead to instant-Deaths of Characters in Combats when an Enemy all of a sudden grabs a Party member to kill them via Animation.

I recommend this Game to Players who like a good Fantasy RPG and who also want to explore a huge Gameworld.

[h3]Points i give this Game (average Points 8,46 / 10):[/h3]
8,2 / 10 Graphic (Old, but for the Time of Release very well made)
8 / 10 Art-Style (Different Locations are well detailed to give a unique vibe to them and have a lot of Assets to be explored)
7,3 / 10 Atmosphere (Major Locations have the perfect Atmosphere for the Story, some Side-Locations tho feel generic)
8,5 / 10 Gameplay (Easy to learn Gameplay. Gives Players a lots of Ways to handle Things, including Combat and the choice of Companions)
9,2 / 10 Main-Story (Definitly the strongest Part of the Game that drives the Motivation over all)
9 / 10 Side-Story (Lots of Side-Stories to explore as well, but some sadly don’t feel so impactfull as others and at some Points of Main-Story progress could get lost if not finished first)
8 / 10 Characters (Many Unique Characters to meet and talk to that really fit perfectly into the Stories)
9,5 / 10 Soundtracks (Well implemented Soundtracks. Soundtracks should always be used to support the Atmosphere of scenes in Games.)

~Waiting on ME4 or is it 5 ..",True,1
17470,"For me, the survival horror par excellence. The major difficulties offer the lethality of the necromorphs along with the scarcity of resources that result in a total nightmare this game.

Dead Space starts from a ""gofer"" gameplay, or going from here to there repairing things or activating others when other characters indicate it. In the course of a place to another, we find a lot of tension along these roads that is achieved mainly by a sound that for me, is the best achieved in a video game.

The guys at EA have managed to create a survival horror that fills you with an incredible sense of loneliness as you walk through endless corridors with cold lights, waiting for a small movement that precedes a battle where ammunition is scarce and you must play tactically.
As for its plot is perfect and can also serve as a context and excuse to fill the screen with horrendous creatures.
The music is very basic, relying more on sound effects to introduce us to its terrifying and cold atmosphere.

Dead Space is a great game and very addictive, it's like a drug that traps you in everything, the story, the characters, the loneliness, the insecurity, the scares, the fate of each person, the atmosphere, the sound, the soundtrack, the designs, the enemies, the gameplay, the scarce ammunition and the tension or fear of continuing to advance.

Without anything else to say, Dead Space is a marvel. Both for its story and its gameplay. It does not bore a single second and also always have that feeling of tension and loneliness thanks to the perfect atmosphere that enjoys the title.",True,7

[*] Damn, I miss the time, when devs would introduce innovations and improve on mechanics even if they are heavily inspired by other games.
[*] Inspired heavily by some of the GOATs: RE4 and System Shock 2. I could find influences from Half-Life, Alien, Event Horizon, and The Thing also.
[*] This didn't need a remake. It's ok, just not the definitive upgrade like many claim it to be. It's just a shiny paint job with Dead Space 2 mechanics, interconnected areas a la Dead Space 2, modern politics, and darkness while adding additional lore with bite-sized side missions.

[*] Outside of immersive sims, this is the most immersive game I've ever played. The suit acting as the healthbar is such a simple, yet intuitive move.
[*] Aces the survival/action horror aspect in space with S-tier sound design, thick atmosphere with impeccable lighting, competent inventory management, and well-tuned resource drops.
[*] Innovates on RE4's precision shooting to give us the ""strategic dismemberment"" mechanics. A uniquely amusing way to defeat monsters that none even dared to replicate.
[*] Glorious death animations. Papa RE4 would be so proud!
[*] The Zero-G sections are creative, intense, and an absolute blast!
[*] High replayability with multiple difficulties that add meaningful challenge.
[*] Who knew the mining tools would make for such a compelling combat system?
[*] Sick monster design and AI. It's nerve-racking when these mofos sprint at you haha!
[*] Super engaging plot with believable characters. The world building, environmental storytelling, and lore are admirable also.

18000,"A begrudging thumbs up. The game has problems. The biggest of which is the consumable system. There are a ton of consumables, but no currency or shops. You absolutely need to be using buff and debuff items on every single trash fight, so you have to keep stocked. Everything is sourced from respawning chests and trash cans scattered around the maps. They don't cost anything aside from the hassle of wandering around smashing chests over and over. This means that if you want to restock a particular item, you just have to keep smashing chests and hoping for the best. 

 Also, the game's sense of humor is awful. This game thinks it's hilarious to mock the homeless. One of the primary enemy types are ""hobos,"" one of which has an attack where he brandishes a sign with ""down on my luck"" written on it. I don't think I have to explain why this is problematic.

It's absurd, it's ridiculous. It's also colorful and fun and reminds me of some fo the more twisted cartoons of my youth like Ren and Stimpy, Invader Zim and The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy. 

The Baconing is a pretty simple game at its core, but has more complex equipment and item systems than what I was expecting. On the one hand it's kind of a button masher, but some fo the mechanics are overly complex for such a game.

The second wonderful thing about this game is the art. I'm not one to get gushy about art, but the quality and the variety is really stunning.

The cons are this though; The gameplay, specifically the difficulty (through awkwardness/poor design choices) , does not match the game style. I can see Futurama watchers firing up this game, perhaps after taking a long pull on a ...cigar. This will not go well for them: the combat is brutal.

Though the visual aesthetic is generally appealing, the simple gameplay gets really repetitive quick. Unfortunately, same goes for the humour. RPG's are really good targets for parody, but it seems like the Baconing misses the point on occasion and when it hits the target, it doesn't quite have the right delivery. The voice acting of the main character gets really grating by the end, even though the game isn't that long.

Repeat until you beat... or in the case of this game, don't bother. Because it's not even worth it. The orbit gimmick is stupid and never should have left the drawing board. Forcing players to memorize sequences and deal with RNG on top of that nonsense (to say nothing of the glitches and gotchas that ruin round after round) is just lazy tower defense design and a luminary like Futuremark should be ashamed of themselves. With the gameplay removed this would be a great screensaver, but a great game it is not.

I love tower defense games, but man do I hate tower defense games like Unstoppable Gorg. The music, art, and presentation are all top notch -- I especially love the bad sci-fi movietone reel feel.

But no, it's not. Far from it, because the gameplay is just utter crap. First of all the TD mechanic is SUPER restrictive and completely un-intuitive, sure it looked like a nifty concept, but the execution is below subpar. It's like the game is actually a puzzle and it's forcing you to find the correct and only strategy to win each map because god knows there's no room for having fun with different setups.

On top of it, the towers themselves are honestly quite boring and the game doesn't really add anything new to the genre, except for that awkward, weird and ultimately failed rotationary orbital system that forces you to find the correct solution and micromanage like crazy as well.

And again, it's a shame because the rest of the package is really cool. I mean, it's cheesy as hell, but that's intended, and it really works... So in the end, I'm afraid I can't recommend this, as much as I'd like to, purely in terms of gameplay and fun. It's not very fun to play, honestly.

However, environment settings and space themed Tower defense felt alluding at first making me coerced try my favourite category of games but this is nowhere fun to any other tower defense I played.

There are various orbits to place towers around whatever base you are trying to protect for a given mission, but there are only certain spots in each orbit where it is allowed. The key is that once towers are placed, you can rotate the orbits effectively moving your towers to defend different lines of attack. There are a handful of different alien types, about 20 different tower types, and basic damage upgrades to those towers.

The hardest part in the game that I found was generating enough income to purchase towers plus the story is pretty comical making this a game hard to take seriously.",False,7
18120,"Unstoppable Gorg is delightfully corny in so many ways, from its visuals, to its music, to them going to the trouble of making black and white live action film of people acting for the stuff in between missions. There are various towers with different purposes and enough variation between them to make it worthwhile to select certain towers over others depending on upcoming enemy composition, etc. I really like not only the idea, but much of the execution for the game.

However, my one hangup with it is what probably sets it apart the most from other tower defense games: tower mobility. You place a tower on an orbital ring, and can typically place others on the same orbital ring, on the opposite of that ring, or even on the side of it. Then you click the left mouse button on the tower and can spin it around to the other side of your defense point to take out incoming enemies. 

The big issue for someone like me is that I'm pretty darn ADD, and anyone who suffers from it to my extent may find themselves getting overwhelmed by incoming attack waves while trying to keep track of the [i]simultaneous[/i] attacks from different sides, from different enemy compositions, while having to try to spin the right towers on the right rings into the right spots to defend.

It's just too much I have to keep up with at the same time to be capable of doing so. If towers were stationary and the game was designed around that instead, this could be a massive hit with me, but as it is, this feature makes the game incredibly difficult even on lower settings. Anyone with a huge attention span and dexterity who can keep up with and react to a lot of things happening on-screen at once would probably dig this game if they're into TDs and cornball stuff, while those with attention span or dexterity problems might do well to avoid what would otherwise be a pleasant experience.",False,6

18300,"Mediocre but fun marble platformer, recommended for marble enthusiasts - 6/10

Spectraball is a marble platformer with 7 stages and a few minigames. The first few levels are fairly well made and have an interesting atmosphere to them, unfortunately the later levels get a bit boring and repetitive. 
The ""puzzle"" tag confuses a bit, as there is no real puzzling involved, besides from minor pathfinding, so do not expect puzzles like I did. The minigames are fun, although they won't entertain you for a long time.

Overall the games biggest flaw is lacking optimisation: 
- the controls feel clunky, often times not properly registering a jump 
- the red boosters often used are very buggy leading to not getting the speed and failing a jump
- some levels feel unfinished, especially the minigames could have some more work done

There are not many games in the genre so try it out, even with all the flaws it can be good fun. I wish the game would be have been optimised a bit more.


100%-Achievement-Difficulty: Middle to Hard. You have to finish all stages in a row without falling off, although you can restart the current level from the beginning if you fall off. Still pretty hard, especially the last stage.

18400,"This game dissapoints me. It runs fun on my computer and I have no trouble getting it running on any of my laptops but as an incredible machine style game it fails on several levels.
The first is the Part variety, now there is a wide range of interesting parts and even some that use Nvidia physx, I particularly like the water physics, HOWEVER there is a distinct lack of things like walls, floors and slopes in player made puzzles. Yeah you see all those curved walls everywhere in the screenshots? To the best of my knowledge you either have to unlock those or cannot use those at all in your own puzzles. Also the only walls you can make can be broken and both the shelves and walls have very limited size.
This leaves me feeling creatively stunted as it looks like I more or less have to use everything they give me in very specific ways rather than letting me expeiriment with using things in ways other than its primary use.

The other thing that dissapoints me about this game is that they slapped a completely arbitrary limit on how many of every item you can use in free build mode, granted its 20 per item but its still dissapointing to see item limits applied to specific items rather than across the entire contraption as a whole.

I did not have trouble getting the game to run, it started up completely fine for me but I've heard that some people have issues with getting the game to run and I cannot comment on that because I don't have that issue.

Now when I saw this game back whenever I bought it several years ago I had three things on my mind that sold me on it ""its the incredible machine, it has physx, and its in 3d."" Having spent a LONG time as a kid throwing together rube goldberg contraptions in the incredible machine this sounded like a dream come true for me. And then the let downs started rolling in:
First: you don't have all the parts unlocked at the start, you have to go through the campaign to unlock them, this is bad because you don't have all the tools nessasary to start building puzzles on your own. 
Second: the way the basic walls and floors are discourages building more interesting puzzles because you cannot effectively seperate things out to force the player to think the way you want them to
Third: the campaign puzzles seem arbitrary and lack a lot of the life puzzles in the incredible machine had, the decoration elements are very much lacking compared to what you could do in the incredible machine(meaning I hope you like the brick background because you'll be seeing it a LOT)
Fourth: Physx is cool but I get the impression that even with the fluids dlc(which came out some years after the game itself) that it isn't being used effectively, it seems to work fine for solid body physics but considering the trouble it causes for people to install the game I would have liked to have more things be destructable(like some of the floor blocks in the incredible machine)

All in all I'm dissapointed in Crazy Machines 2 as a follow up to the incredible machine because I think moving to 3d put a lot of the basic mechanics a step back even while it added more advanced mechanics. I don't feel like these new mechanics have as much potential for interesting puzzles or are as open ended or well thought out as some of the things in the original Incredible Machine game.",False,25
18400,"Negative review which is not related to the actual design of the game...or wait, maybe it is.

The developers decided to make this ""PhysX"" based. Unfortunately that means that if you're (most likely) not using the supplied PhysX version some levels are simply uncompletable. Of course you could be rolling back to the ""correct"" version of PhysX, but whoever designs a game to only run correctly on ONE version of a graphics driver that is being CONSTANTLY updated has a severe lack of foresight. I just completed the last CM 1 missions and the game to this day and age still works flawlessly. Why fuck with that formula and introduce randomly behaving elements that can break the game? Very nice.

So far it's only levels 1-4 (spoke doesn't move) and 1-7 (barrels do not behave the way they are supposed to), but I wonder how many more levels are broken and of course never fixed. The devs have even acknowledged these issues, but they didn't seem to be interested in fixing them. Old game and all. Even in levels that can be completed the physics are somewhat questionable (if a ball hits a spring it should be catapulted back based on its weight and the speed with which it hit the spring...this is clearly not the case...at all, it's just random). That's why it gets an automatic ""not recommended"". Apart from that the game launches at least.

To give you an example of 1-7: There are 3 barrels that need to be delivered into the end zone in a particular order. However, the barrels don't move the way they should at the start (where you can't even influence them). I was able to get all barrels into the end zone, but the order is impossible to achieve, which results in mission failure. I tried it with a guide, I watched YouTube videos. The barrels just behave differently. I even tried the integrated solution system in the game, which auto solves a level. Well, that one can't even get all barrels to the end zone. They get stuck well before. So, it's clearly a PhysX issue. I refuse to go through the hassle of uninstalling PhysX and reinstalling the old version. Since it is not possible to have 2 versions installed and all other games might break if I do that and because it's generally a lot of hassle...

So yea, it's pretty nice. It introduces few character-like elements, quite unusual thing for Crazy Machines series, and a few others Stone Age elements. Though, having only one theme for majority of playtime may sound somewhat tired, music isn't much hot either.

The puzzles don't disappoint. They start quite easy when introducing new elements and then get as complicated as in the original CM2. They however lack the instructions, you have to press ""i"" icon to get some. They also rarely have bonus objectives.
It's still was quite addictive to solve all these puzzles, with some slight placing requirements. There are some puzzles where you will have to tweak around to make physics of unrelated object work for you, but there is no outright broken puzzles like in Back to Shop. Also, protip: ice cube isn't perfect cube.

18408,"I experienced a progression breaking bug in the very first level, which halts the progression onward from the first chapter. There's several chapters in total. Single chapter dlc's seem to not have this game crashing bug.

I do not recommend to buy this particular Add-On. Also, Back to the Shop Add-On seems to have the same game crashing, progression halting problem.

Edit: I found the issue: For some reason this Add-On and Back to the Shop seem to conflict with the Anniversary dlc. As long as I have the Anniversary dlc installed, these two Add-Ons crash when I try to play them. When I unticked Anniversary from my installed dlc's list, the two Add-Ons started working.

Still, I don't really recommend this one. The dinosaurs have this weird, almost toy-like quality to them, creating sort of an uncanny valley. At least the puzzles seem to work, unlike in some of the puzzles in Back to the Shop Add-On. There's also no voice acting in the puzzle introductions. In my opinion the majority of the dlc's are better than the Add-Ons.",False,1
18420,"Crazy Machines is often overlooked ""successor"" to Incredible Machines, so to say. No, not officially, but it did delivered fun of same genre during years when there was no similiar game.

Even though it's not modern game, it still should run just fine, albeit not supporting widescreen resolution. it comes with two packs of puzzles (that you can pick in ""Change Lab""), each having around 100 puzzles, with New Challenges coming out later and introducing new elements. There are also 3 music that you can choose in options, game repeating only one of them all time. Really, Game Music 3 is the best one, immeditly choose this, great upbeat melody.
No idea how and when New Challenges and two new music tracks came to be, maybe they were patched or came bundled with new version of the game... There is really no info on Internet on them. I only remember playing Russian version which lacked those, with different title screen. Professor, who's head pops randomly to give useless random phrase, was the best there. Biased. And yes, you can disable him in options too.

So yes, to those unfamiliar, each puzzle is about placing available elements on the level, testing and if it doesn't work, then you are off to replacing, either slightly tweaking position or completely changing whole plan. But where Incredible Machines had more of wacky elements, Crazy Machines gives you more of ""realistical"" set of items, like bucket and magnet. And, importanly, while doing so, it introduces a more advanced physics, more modern, being more complex than in Incredible Machines. And that is unique strong point of this game. Not to mentioning that it's always great to have more games in this genre, well-done ones at least.
You got usual physics, electricity, gravity (in New Challenges) and steam to handle. Great stuff. Setting is quite jolly too.

Yet the game isn't as perfect as I wanted it to be. There are a lot of situation where you have to place object pretty much pixel-perfect. Yes. Move that mouse slowly while holding button. Don't twitch. Test 100 times until it works.
And even then some of the puzzles are so out of the box... Well, no, it sounds like positive thing. What I meant, is that some puzzles have solution that appears like physics exploits. Example: in one of the level you have 3 conveyer belts to place, to somehow deliver a box on top of a platform that is way above. What is solution? Place two converyer belts together so the box will get stuck between them and with enough pixel-perfect placing it will roll around and somehow get shot out onto platform. Work of a genius!
Yes, after this you can never be sure if solution is something sane or not, making you want instead check walkthroughs.
I might go futher and just say that learning curve in this game is simply horrible and difficulty is uneven, not exactly always enjoyable... But I still like this game.

The game also allows you to create your own levels, fully. Using interface that may confuse for first impression. (How to put element into player inventory? Put element into level and then choose it and click on lock icon. Will not appear on level itself after this). But otherwise, you can do as much as normal levels can, setting up task too. Then you can save experiement and uhm, find a friend who playes this game too and maybe wants to try your thing, copying file to his computer. Or you can just set up many explosives to watch physics. Yes, no Steam Workshop support.

So, while Crazy Machines gives a good spin and has it's place in a genre, it has some flawed puzzles that worsen up whole offer and taste. Otherwise, ignoring them, I can recommend it. Just not whole-heartly.


P.S.  Also check out Crazy Machines 1.5 if you like this one,more of same. Quite good from what it appears. Because of the screwy way developers handled that ""2-games-as-1"" app, no one can review it. HA.",True,17

18420,"[b][i]Crazy Machines[/i][/b] is a mind puzzle game. As the apprentice of a wacky inventor, complete the puzzles to achieve specific effects using a limited amount of knick-knacks.

[b]Pros[/b]: This starts out as a fairly simple game with a low learning curve, new elements being introduced as you progress from puzzle to puzzle. You can test the effect of the solution as often as you'd like, which you'll be required to do, regularly needing to adjust your setup and check how different the effect is. The physics of the game, although not fully realistic, are close enough to help guess how most pieces work and wrap your head around it.

[b]Cons[/b]: The difficulty isn't as gradual as it could be. You might have a hard puzzle that requires you to adjust one or more item by a pixel, over and over until it works, followed by an extremely straightforward puzzle right after. The hint system is very limited, are rarely actually help. Graphics are showing their age.

[b]Verdict[/b]: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to you

All and all, [i]Crazy Machines[/i] is exactly what it sets out to be, and there is no mistaking that it follows directly in the footsteps of [i]The Incredible Machines[/i]. If that's what you're looking for, you won't care about the graphics and this game has the cheapest puzzle/$ ratio of the franchise. This game is void of any action or excitement, but rather is meant to make you stop, think, observe and resolve the puzzle. If it's what you're looking for, you won't be disappointed.

18470,"So, [b]Helldorado[/b]... You can call it [b]Desperados 2.5[/b] because, well, that's what it is. Comes with a pretty funny story, though. See, at some point [b]Spellbound Entertainment[/b] ended up being so obsessed with making [b]Commandos[/b] clones that one of them ([b]Chicago 1930[/b]) failed pretty hard. Why? Well, for many reasons, I guess. It didn't get enough press, it was far from being the best game from [b]Spellbound[/b] (even though it sure had a certain charm and came with a bunch of fresh ideas, it was still the worst in my opinion), while there were already too many of such games on market. As funny as it sounds nowadays (the entire sub-genre pretty much died with [b]Spellbound[/b], until [b]Mimimi[/b] picked it up and gave it a new life in their [b]Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shōgun[/b]), [b]Spellbound[/b] alone used to produce a new game of that kind every bloody year, while there were also [b]PYRO[/b], who started the entire thing and some other minor games. Like [b]KOREA: Forgotten Conflict[/b]. It was like with all those games from [b]Ubisoft[/b] nowadays. At some point people were like “[i]Seriously? Another one of those? Seriously?[/i]”. It was also somewhat buggy, so... yeah. It failed. And when it did, [b]Spellbound[/b] started to fire people.

Unfortunately, with a brand new team behind [b]Desperados 2[/b], they also lost the only thing that used to make their games so cool. I mean, seriously. The original [b]Desperados[/b] team? The guys knew what they were doin'. They loved [b]Commandos[/b] and they wanted to improve it and explore the new horizons. Like, personally, I really wanted [b]Vampire Hunter[/b] game to happen. All that while [b]Desperados 2[/b] team just... blew it. They've ruined pretty much everything that the original [b]Desperados[/b] did right, while the new game turned out so cheap and ugly that it felt unfinished. So, naturally, even though [b]Spellbound[/b] already worked on the expansion and almost finished it, [b]ATARI[/b] said “Nope, we don't need any more of [i]that![/i] Thank you very much.” What did [b]Spellbound[/b] do? Well, they tried to save the project. The best they can. They eventually found the publisher and released the expansion as a stand-alone game called [b]Helldorado[/b]. Because why the hell not.

So, that's pretty much the story here. It's called [b]Helldorado[/b], but all in all, it's an expansion to [b]Desperados 2[/b]. Or [b]Desperados 2.5[/b], call it any way you want. But enough about that. Already wasted quite a lot of time on that, so... let's look at the game itself, shall we? Well, we shall, but... the funniest thing is – there isn't much to talk about here. I mean, what do you expect? The game started as a bloody expansion and, well, it feels that way too. For both good and bad (mostly bad, though, mostly bad...) it's still [b]Desperados 2[/b]. Can't say nothing's changed, though. Quite the opposite. The character models were heavily improved and are now highlighted in the way similar to the first game (which is a good thing since it makes them easier to see and control), the goals are way better explained now and even have marks on the ground to make things easier for you, while the new “combo” system that allows you to give the same task for all the characters who can perform it is pretty cool and useful. Just select all the guys and send them to kick the heck out of the bandits. Then just sit back and enjoy the brawl. Like I said, useful.

Aside from that, though, what we have here is pretty much the same [b]Desperados 2[/b]... thing. The story picks up right when [b]Desperados 2[/b] ended (yes, it begins with that weird scene about the [b]Doc[/b]), but it's still cheesy as heck and absolutely terribly written, while gameplay still feels cheap and rough. Heck, they even forgot to put one of the important libraries on disc! Not really a problem with the [b]Steam[/b] version (you may still need to install the legacy [b]PhysX[/b] drivers, though), but I still remember the day when I tried to launch the game from disc for the very first time. I mean, come on! How many games miss the important libraries on physical media? Did you even test the bloody thing, [b]Spellbound[/b]?

Sure, the game is totally playable in its current state, but, like with the original [b]Desperados 2[/b], you'll hardly want to waste your time on it. You like the genre and already finished everything else from [b]PYRO[/b], [b]Spellbound[/b] and [b]Mimimi[/b]? Then, and only then, you may consider wasting your time on this game.

Helldorado still use the same assets and mechanics from previous Desperados 2, with lot of improvement and new features.

+ Combo system, it's a nice feature.
+ Film mode for quick action. This is an awesome feature.
+ Better UI and better mini map, now you can see clearly where's the objectives. And also, now the mini map will rotate while aiming in the third person view.
+ They bring back the old highlight mechanic. Now, everyone will be highlighted. In Desperados 2, we can't see enemies behind a wall on inside the house.
 
The reason why I still not recommend this game:
- They remove those nice music from desperados 2, music in this game are boring.
- This game still has major bugs. From I can't pick up the body to missing medal. I myself missing the gold medal for mission IV.1, I try to retry the mission, but nothing seems to work.
- Pablo Sanchez still nerfed. He still can't carry 2 person at the same time.
- Kate O'Hara still have the weakest gun.
- Using the same shooting mechanics in both mode (isometric and third person view). In third person view there's no difference between shooting the head and the body.

18470,"If you have played Desperados Wanted Dead or Alive and the disappointment that was Desperados 2, Helldorado wraps things up pretty nicely!
The good:
1. Bug fixes: Helldorado makes a lot of improvements to Desperados 2
2. 3rd person shooter mode is still fun and feels essential for some missions. 
3. Combos! There are several fun actions that combine different skills of characters together. Example: Dynamite arrows!
4. There is a tutorial that goes over some of the new and old features.
5. An improvement from Desperados 2 is that some of the maps actually feel like stealth puzzles rather than a tedious game of ""knock enemies out and hide bodies."" Those missions or parts of missions were very satisfying the first time around.
6. You are given a 2 statement review of how well you played: one based on if you were shot or not and another based on how many times you were spotted (I think).
7. It's pretty!

Some good and bad changes to abilities compared to Desperados 1: 
- There are no more houses that you could disappear into in D1. The cross-section is shown for all the accessible buildings.
- no gatling guns
- limited ammo but enemies drop a lot
- all characters can knock people out but only some can tie them.
- Mia is MIA. Instead, you get Hawk Eye, a Native American.
- Cooper's Quick-Action fast-shooting is gone. 
- Kate's main abilities have been reduced to seduction and fainting. These seldom work on enemies. She is severely physically weakened. Her powerful kick was removed in Desperados 2 in favor of 2 punch knockouts (first punch stuns, second punch knocks out for a short time). In Helldorado, her punches have no effect at all on the larger enemies. (I did find a good use for the ""stun"" on her solo mission though. Once.) She also has a make up powder that blinds enemies indefinitely but other enemies don't notice.
- Sam: The snake is replaced by cans of nitroglycerin (mines) which are loud. 
- Doc: no balloons. But KO gas is permanent until woken up by others.
- Sanchez: powerful KO but can't pick up 2 bodies. No more siestas. No more multi-enemy KO.
- Hawkeye: Probably the most fun character to play because of his stealthy movement, silent (limited) arrows and the ability to fully restore the health for all allies in a large area (which makes doc's First Aid look like a joke). However, his ""war cry"" is made even more useless in Helldorado. And he is only available for a very few missions.

The bad:
1. bugs: 
- the gold awards for completing missions in ""desperados"" difficulty are sometimes not awarded, or they disappear.
- some knocked out enemies may ragdoll and fly away
- characters may not respond to click commands
- the maps are a little difficult to view in wide screen
- I needed to play it in ""compatibility mode for Windows Vista"" to get it to work.
2. Tedium:
- some maps repeat between missions. Same starting point but the difference is that you have to enter a different building. But it's not as bad as Desperados 2.
3. the cycling ambient noise, voices, music and character voice-overs can get annoying during the missions.

The main issue with the game is repetitiveness. You have a huge amount of discussions, repetitive OST, repetitive puzzles, impossible dance mini game (another repetitive puzzle) and a bit too much of going between towns.

Howeber, i'm sorry to say, this was until I heard the utterly depressing narative and the voice of the main character Sadwick which frankly made me want to hang myself.

Note to Daedalic - whilst I don't expect all games to necessarily be upbeat, I do expect the initial premise to be something less final than 'Sadwick destroys the world'.

Can't recommend for those reasons, sorry guys.",False,4
18490,"I bought this game due to my enjoyment of the Deponia franchise and I have to admit, it's a lot of fun. Very funny and the puzzles are very difficult, however in some cases that can be too difficult due to many items being almost too well hidden in the background. In some cases I couldn't find the item at all until the walkthrough mentioned it was there.

The ending is quite a twist and a very deep ending too. Worth a buy if you enjoy the deponia series, though it has crashed every once and a while.",True,3
18490,"The Whispered World is an old style P.O.C. game from Daedalic games. How does it hold?
Story- Sadwick is a sad little clown who has a reoccouring knightmare about him destroying the world. So he begins a quest in order to change his fate and save the world. Now, a word of warning, do not expect a happy game. There is a bit of humor in the game and a cast of colorful characters but the story is, altogether, rather dark and brooding. But it is a well written fantasy epic that is worth checking out. A+
Graphics- This game is very beautiful to look at. The environments are wonderfully illustrated and colorful and shows that alot of imagination and care went into each scene. The character designs are drawn and animated beautifully as well and is never dull to look at (though is it just me or did they gather some inspiration from Tim Schaffer's ""Brutal Legends"" for the main villain?) The animated cutscenes were good but felt like a direct to VHS movie from the 90's. It's not bad but would does not hold up to other games of note. A-
Sound- Okay, so this is the main complaint of the game. The voice of Sadwick will make you want to hang yourself. It is even worse considering how he is always depressed. Other characters sound much better and I even say that my personal favorite voices are the rocks you meet in the game (yes, Rocks sound better than the main hero). The music is also very beautiful and give off an appropreat atmosphere. But then there is Sadwick. A-
Gameplay- The game follows a very simple P.O.C. interface so no challenge there. If there was an issue to the game, it would be that all too often there will be items that need to be collected but are impossible to see in the backgrounds. Now this would not be an issue but at times these are very small items that will not register on the pointer unless you are spot on, and this may entail you to know exactly what you are looking for in the first place.

All of the characters have superb voice acting, especially compared to some other Daedelic games.

This DLC is different from all the previous ones (aside from the Portal theme), in that every level throws in some new and interesting twist unlike anything seen in the main game. I guarantee you will be surprised at some of the unique wrenches GLaDOS throws into the works. It's really fun, and also challenging. Definitely pick this one up if you already own DG, or maybe even if you don't. And now, if you'll excuse me, I must get back to playing all of the alternate game modes :) ...",True,26

18522,"This DLC adds excellent levels and GLaDOS (and all the heckling that goes along with that)!

The combination of the Portal (game by Valve) graphics and GLaDOS voice/character into the Defense Grid world was excellent.  While the DLC on the whole is really very good and recommended, the DLC needed some level-balancing...the very first level took me about 5 tries to find a path/solution that would even remotely work and, for me, was by far the toughest map of the entire DLC.  A couple other maps in this DLC gave me challenges too, but that's part of the fun; only that first map, I thought was too tough, especially for a first map of a DLC.

This DLC is also unique in that it would come up with 'twists' during the level...it would remove a couple towers, or not allow you to build a certain type of tower, or only allow you to place command towers while it placed all other turrets, etc.  This DLC made for unique set of challenges and a lot of fun.

Despite the 8 maps, however, this is a short DLC taking only roughly 2.5hrs to complete the campaign and that's including my struggling on 2 of the levels.

Not quite as good as the Resurgence DLC set (my favorite), but certainly a very nice DLC indeed.  8.5 out of 10

18522,"First of all, I love the base game, it's one of the best TD games out there. Having said that, I don't understand how this mediocre DLC gets so highly rated. A good TD level is all about strategy, you look at the layout of the level and place your towers, you can plan your defence from the start and if you done it right, you don't have to rush or sell towers. This DLC is not about strategy, it's purely about trial and error.

One of the few issues the base game had is that a small number of levels required time perfect tower placement and upgrades to get Gold medals. You've kept all the cores and you have thousands of credits left over when the last enemy dies and yet you miss out on the gold because your score is 2% off the required score. Your strategy has worked flawlessly but you missed out because your placement/upgrades were not time perfect. It's a frustrating and unnecessary requirement that adds precisely zero value to the game. What was a small issue in the base game that only affected 2 or 3 levels is turned up to 11 and affects most levels in this DLC. The way you work through this is by repeatedly replaying the level, slightly changing the timing of upgrades. It's not good design.",False,9

The levels feature a continuation of the storyline where the main game left off and also introduces a couple of new characters, which is pretty cool (though the voice acting leaves much to be desired). Although some of the new levels feature different types of environments, nothing has fundamentally changed about the core gameplay (same towers, same strategies, etc). And just to be clear - I'm not saying that's a bad thing. This is pretty much all I want or need out of a Defense Grid DLC. That said, I do have one slight disappointment, which is that these levels all seem particularly easy (or maybe I've just gotten better at the game... I dunno).

A couple maps proved rather challenging (for me anyway), requiring me to completely restart them several times before I found a working strategy.

Although, it lacks any sense of progression, it's still quite fun and sucks you in to the extent that you just lose track of how much time you've played.

It may not be everyone's thing, but I highly recommend checking it out.

However, I do have an issue with the $9.99 dollar price tag; at most, it should be for $5.00 dollars because it's not particurally feature rich, and not a whole ot of people even bother with playing online with the game, if any at all.

It's a dead game in terms of updates; however, this doesn't mean the game is buggy, it seems to be fairly polished with the exception of weird AI behavior at timesand the fact that the game can be easy sauce when using simple strategies such as only holding a few planets and ""upgrading"" them and ammasing a ton of ships just to roflstomp your enemies.",True,14

18600,"While the devs describe this game as a 'streamlined take on the classic ""4x"" genre', that's a bit of an overstatement. It's pretty much just a straight line. There realy isn't much to do other than build up an fleet and try to overwhelm everything as you expand outward. Other than your ships, the only resource to manage is upgrading factories on planets so they will build more ships each turn. This does forfit any ship building for that planet that turn and the only limit is that you can only upgrade one factory per turn & a particular factory cannot be upgraded on consecutive turns.

The main negative of this game is that there is no online community anymore, meaning that there are 3 achievements that will be impossible to earn without help from friends who also own this game.

So why do I recommend it? Because sometimes simple is fun. It's easy to generate a small map and have a quick game that you can finish in under 15 minutes or pull up a huge one for an 8 player last-man-standing war that can last a while. If you either allow the adaptive AI to level up as you win games (or raise it manually), eventually your opponents will put up a decent fight. If they get to be too much, you can always knock it down a bit to make it challenging and fun for you the player (and turn off adaptive AI).

Two fleets might pass one another on long voyages, leaving an undefended planet for attackers to conquer while the planet that fleet departed from gets demolished by the enemy fleet that just left the planet they attacked. If it sounds confusing, it can be odd to try to outthink your opponents to attack them but defend your own holdings, but there's no tech tree or micromanagement to handle.

The biggest annoyance was the world navigating. While it takes only a few seconds for the character to walk form A to B, the actual walking is completely pointless, and there is lots of walking from A to B. It is even more irritating because the game shows you were you have to go by having a sparkling effect walking from A to B... So often you have to wait for the ""effect"" to go, and then immediately after you spend the same amount of time ""going"" there yourself. Maybe I missed a key which would skip all this walking?

It's a poor imitation of the original Rocket Knight Adventures game: instead of sharp, responsive controls, Rocket Knight suffers from floaty controls and poor hit detection. To be honest, there's little to describe the game other than 'mediocre' - mediocre platforming, mediocre Gradius-style flight sections, mediocre soundtrack (even the remixed first level theme feels weak and listless). The game's definitely beautiful, though, in a charming CGI-cartoon-character kind of way - lots of wacky cartoon contraptions and scenery to be seen.

It's nothing special, but if you have an afternoon to waste ... eh.

[edit] Further thoughts: the game itself recommends that you use a controller; but despite being a console port, all of the button prompts displayed - both in menus and in-game - assume you're using the keyboard, whether or not you are using a controller (tested with a wired Xbox 360 pad). There's no option to re-map controls, either, and the 'Controls' screen only displays the keyboard mappings.
In later sections of the game, you're pitted against enemies with rapid-fire projectile weapons - which, combined with Sparkster's poor manoeuvrability and tendency to fall 'into' enemies, quickly becomes frustrating.
The jetpack mechanic is flawed - rather than recharge at a set rate, it rapidly recharges to about 75% capacity, and then continues to recharge to 100% at a snail's pace. So after performing a platforming section, or two of your three possible offensive moves, you'll be waiting for your bar to slooooowly recharge to full. Pointless.
If you can think of a platforming game sin - blind-faith leaps onto off-screen platforms, tiny platforms located above falls into nothingness, timed platforming sections, enemies with shields or invulnerability while attacking - this game features them.
The enemy AI is terrible - they'll either attack you head-on, or fruitlessly attempt to attack you through the floor.
Finally, the main menu is set up so that the default option when selecting 'Arcade mode' - i.e. the main mode of play - is 'New Game', even if you already have a saved game in progress. It's a minor annoyance, but surely the default option should have been 'Continue'?...",False,51
19030,"Rocket Knight!

Excellently fun game that takes things back to the basics, and it works, its a breath of fresh air.
If you played Rocket Knight Adventures 1 and 2 before, then you'll enjoy this game just as much, the gameplay is pretty much the same as the classic with a few improvements made here and there.

The game still comprises of platforming segmants, boss battles and of course, the flying segments which play in the same way
a side scrolling shoot'em up plays, all in all, a nice variation and all of these sections are fun in their own way.

The music and sound effects are nothing to write home about but they do a good enough job with a few memorable themes here and there.

The graphics are the biggest change in this game as it is now 2.5D and it looks great, nice and cartoony and it keeps the feel of the originals whilst updating them and it looks lovely.

My personal opinion : If you're gonna go from a side scrolling 2D game, and try to give it a modern spin, keep it 2.5D, I think this is where the Sonic Series lost control and came off the rails a bit.",True,13

19030,"I've never been one to write reviews, but as a huge fan of the original Rocket Knight game for genisis I felt like I had to get this game. Seeing it brought back so many good memories... Playing it however... Where to start on just how bad this game is.

Starting with the game play, it is nothing like the original. The levels are boring, the enemies are weak, and the controls just suck on so many levels. The original game gave you a lot to try and each had a reason for being there. This game, just spam the launch buttom and your good. And forget about cool boss fights.

The graphics are also crappy. I don't think I've said this about any 3D game ever past the early 2000s but the Original game looks so much better! The colors where bright and stood out. The sprites seemed to lively and fun. But this one just flat out sucks. It's so ugly and bland looking color wise. No fun bright cartoony characters or enemies. It feels less like a sequal or reboot, and more like a cash grab.

Music wish, something I've never thought I'd touch on in a review. The old game had wonderful music, and even some of the most wonderful and exciting music of the day for games. I remember the speed of the bosses I'd fight picking up as the music went faster, or charging into the pigs kingdom to the rocking beats that fit so well to going against the army of the enemy pig king... This game doesn't even change it's slow, boring music when you get in a boss fight. You will just feel out of it every time you are doing something.

I never give stars or points, as I feel most people like what they like. A game that is a 5 star for me, might be something someone else hates. But I can not stress this enough. This is a bad game anyway you slice it. Spitting in the face of a classic. Which by the way, get the original before you play this if you really want to see what I mean. Worst steam game I've EVER played!",False,10

Pros
+ Good and fun arcade gameplay.
+ Easy to pick up and play.
+ The Konami Code works in this game so you can unlock costumes and other modes straight away if you just want to mess around for fun.
+ Average graphics for a 2.5D game which was made during the retro revival era.
+ The previous games in this series are awesome
+ You can unlock and play Gold Sparkster 
+ You can unlock and play as Axel Gear (The series big main dark knight villain)

Cons
+ Forgettable soundtrack apart from 2 songs which one is an orchestrated version of the first stage from Rocket Knight Adventures 1 and the other one later in game is inspired by the final stage from the same game.
+ Unforgiving bomb bouncing physics that can lead to health damage or deaths.
+ Shortest game in the series.
+ Out shined by its predecessors.
+ Horrible boss battles and poor attack detection from the player since sparkster has been nerfed in this game.

7.5/10 ""Good""

Its a pretty good game but as a hardcore fan of the Rocket Knight series this one of the weakest entries in the series but that doesn't mean this game is bad, actually all 4 rocket knight games are good with the first game on the Megadrive/Genesis being 10/10 perfection.

The price tag of £12 is overpriced and this game needs to be on sale more often about 75% off its highly recomended for below £5 price tag.

I grew up playing the Rocket Knight Adventures series, this game is pretty good the level design feels less chaotic fun than the predecessors, the level design in later levels feel like they were done on a pretty basic level builder software.

Boss battles and some enemies require to be beaten in a specific way and this game doesn't have friendly hit boxes and physics so you feel slightly under powered compared to the previous games were sparkster was much more funner to control because of he was so over powered.

Your playing as a badass cute furry knight, with a beam sword, a jet pack, and a huge move list throughout the series. Whats not to love? Sparkster is one of the most badass also cutest heroes in gaming if this game isn't your kind of thing then I recomend you play the very first game then work your way to its sequels.

19030,"TL;DR: Designed for children of the modern era, not for fans of the original games.

Difficulty: Easy - The game poses little challenge to anyone but children of the modern era, with one one or two small moments where some thought or skill is required.

Graphics: Good - Consistent style persists throughout and while I don't personally like the childish theme or the re-design of the main character, there's nothing too bad about the graphical direction in general.

Mechanics: Decent - Most mechanics are used enough in general play to warrant being there and most of varying amount of attacks are satisfying to use. Although there is one attack that I never used because there was never had a moment where it could have been useful.

Conveyance: Decent - A little over the top with the controls, but generally nothing offensive; The game's forward path was always obvious.

Music: Good direction, the mood of the scene was conveyed well enough, but the music was nothing memorable; I don't think there was much reference to the old games' music but if there was then it didn't trigger any kind of nostalgia.

Bug: When I got to the part of the game where you jump from airship to airship, the second airship did not show up for me until after I killed myself.",False,6
19030,"Not even close to the Konami classics but it's still an enjoyable platformer. Though not the comeback that we were hoping for, at least Rocket Knight retains its action platformer roots instead of being turned into another horrible 3D adventure game.",True,6
19030,"I remember playing Rocket Knight Adventures on Sega Genesis so many years back.  It was absolutely amazing.  When they released a sequel, Sparkster (Rocket Knight Adventures 2) a year or two later, it wasn't quite as good as the original but still felt true to the series.  In my opinion, these games were Konami's response to Sonic the Hedgehog.

And then things went quiet for Sparkster, our rocket hero.

Then, 15-16 years go by and Konami reveals this game.  A sequel to the original games.

When I first saw the trailer, I was just excited to play this game.  While it has the feel of 3D to it, it has kept the original 2D game play that I grew up with.  Sure, there are some new tricks and moves, but that is how the game has been kept fresh all these years.

They even played a remix of the original Stage 1 theme from RKA.  When I first heard that, so many good memories came rushing back.

A game that you must definitely play.",True,5

19080,"I had rather detailed review all written out, but I switched tabs and ended up losing it as a result, so I will keep it simple this time around. This game is not worth your time, do not play it, do not buy it even if it's on sell for less than 50 cents. It plays and feels like a cheap cellphone game, or even an unfinished prototype. In fact I believe that the game IS unfinished, because the enemy AI is mostly non-existent, the level design is atrocious and the animation is the bare minimal, with some of the enemies having maybe 2 or 3 frames of movement. The game has a lot of bugs and is very glitchy, I ended up using glitches to my advantage just to beat the terribly unbalanced final boss fight due to the game being obviously incomplete. I literally just hid behind the final boss and spammed him with the strongest weapon until he was defeated, that's it, game over I won.

The game has a whole one song that plays 90% of the time, it's a very generic rock song and it's set on an infinite loop, there may be a song that plays during the boss battles, I just can't remember and it was probably just as unmemorable as the fights themselves. The only good thing I can say about the game is that the backgrounds are pretty good, they're very detailed and really fit the overall tone of the levels. Someone obviously put a lot of work into them and it's a shame they were wasted on this game, I really hope the artist(s) moved onto a project that's more worthy of their talent. It's a shame really, becauuse this game could have been rather good, but for whatever reason it seems that the developers completely abandoned it and the publisher released it anyway.

Overall: The game took me about 4 hours to complete, that includes all attempts and when it lost my save data.

With most hidden object games i sit down and complete giant chunks of it at a time and have fun with them. With this one, it took me a very long time to get through it. Some of the objects were very hard to find. They blended into the background a little too much. And then finding the stars to give you more hints was so hard too. Plus, there's the fact that finding all the objects for the room you were working on was timed. And even though there is plenty of time, i have come very close to not making it before the timer ran out. I often found myself getting a headache from this game from a bit of frustration and stress.

However, despite all that, the aspect of making and painting objects to decorate each room was really interesting and fun (even if not getting gold on some of them grinded my nerves a bit) and seeing how all the random objects you found came together was also interesting.

Overall, has enough of a challenge to entertain the hidden object veterens but is casual enough for those who want to take it easy. In the end, I'd recommend it. LOTS of objects to find and an interesting side mechanic to keep things new make it a worthwhile game to play.",True,1

Not coincidentally, Meridian4 made Tank Universal because THEY liked the tank scenes in Tron.
And I bought it because [i]I[/i] like the... well, you know.  And it definitely has a certain Tron vibe, only instead of Jeff Bridges, the protagonist is a bored, incapacitated old man.  Compelling!

Am I glad I bought it?  Yes, because now I don't have to wonder if I was missing out on something great.  So IS Tank Universal great?  No.  Is it worth your time as a die-hard Tron fan?  Possibly.  And if you've never seen Tron?  Less, um... possibly.

Ask yourself:
""[i]Do I enjoy Tron-inspired games where the primary mechanic is mentally calculating how to hit moving targets from a moving vehicle on sloped sufaces with a relatively slow-moving projectile that is affected by gravity (even though the existance of gravity in a digital world makes no sense)?[/i]""
If the answer is ""yes"" and you have $5 to spare, buy Tank Universal.

But also ask yourself:
""[i]Am I deeply annoyed by incoherent/irrelevant storylines, especially when I'm forced to endure them in lengthy, unskippable cinematics?[/i]""
""[i]Do my eyes roll back into my head during tedious, unnecessary travel sequences through static environments with no interaction?[/i]""

""[i]Did I hate Tron?[/i]""

Story wise Tank Universal delivers, I'm only a few hours into the main story but it's pretty fun, the only dissapointment is that they set it up that you're some old guy using a simulation helmet.. ruins a bit of immersion, but oh well! The actual story is pretty fun to play but so far I've realised there's a lot of empty parts of the game where you're just driving endlessly to get to your next objective which can be a bit drab.

When you're actually in a battle though the game is very exciting to play, alongside a ranking up system with Steam achievements to match your rank the game can make it feel rewarding to excel in combat.

Overall? Great game but the level design needs to be worked on, and there's a lack of a proper skirmish mode (Maybe you unlock it when you complete the game?) -Also the music they have in the game.. perfect, well suited to it's theme. 8/10

19200,"This is TRON, 1990's style.

I say this with love for this game, Tank Universal, that without directly infringing on copyright the authors have adapted the game style around our favorite classic movie in an impressive way! Tank Universal sticks to just the tank battles rather than all the different gaming styles it's obvious inspiration, the movie TRON, taught us about. This indie developer hit the mark with a sweet blend of tank simulation that is fun to play. It really feels like you are another human wandering the computer plains in a parallel story to the original TRON movie.

The game only has one real weakness, it wasn't an officially licenses TRON game. Because of this it doesn't have the strongest story line in terms of dialog and has to makes up for it in presentation. It does this in spades however and can keep you engrossed as you truly feel like you are alive in the original TRON world. Most of the time, in game, I felt as though a greater story line could have come about if only the author wasn't skirting copyright. There is an epic sense of why you are playing that feels like it needs stated outright. This is obvious, for those of us who have seen the original TRON. Without being able to state the complete and rather epic story that is hidden within Tank Universals premise, the story comes off shallow and lacking. It feels like we missed the main plot line of something truly epic. Despite this flaw, the game is incredibly fun.

This game is great in what it does, it does WELL! The tank battles are fun, and can be quite challenging! The battlefield is a living environment and there are some decent physics at play. There is even a small amount of strategy in how you attack directly affects the results of battles. Watch as the enemy rebuilds his fortress if you slack off on the attack; beware indirect fire, and call in a Titan to literally tear down your enemies walls.

I only wish that Tank Universal had been a licensed TRON game as this is what the first 3D TRON game should have been. The licensed official game should have been the sequel to this one! All fans of the movie and or tank battles should try this game out!

The game's story is set in Victorian-era London, where Alice has been committed to a mental institution following the death of her family in a fire. As she navigates through the game's twisted and distorted version of reality, Alice confronts a range of characters and situations that reflect the trauma and abuse she has experienced in her life.

The game's unique art style and eerie atmosphere contribute to the overall feeling of unease and discomfort, creating an immersive and emotionally charged experience for the player. Throughout the game, Alice struggles with her sanity and the dark forces that threaten to overwhelm her. The game's story and themes are a commentary on mental health and the effects of trauma on the human psyche, as well as a reflection on the societal norms and expectations that can contribute to such experiences.

Despite its dark themes, Alice: Madness Returns is a game that offers a powerful and thought-provoking exploration of the human experience. It offers a unique blend of action, adventure, and puzzle-solving in a beautifully designed world. The game's focus on mental health and trauma is a welcome change from traditional gaming narratives, and its platforming elements offer a challenging and satisfying experience for players who are looking for something a little different. Overall, Alice: Madness Returns is a game that pushes the boundaries of storytelling and gaming, and is well worth exploring for those who enjoy games that challenge their perceptions and expectations.

In addition to its dark themes and motifs, Alice: Madness Returns is also notable for its striking visuals and imaginative design. One of the most striking features of the game is the beautiful and unique outfits worn by the main character, Alice. These outfits range from a traditional blue and white pinafore dress to a more Gothic and macabre style that fits with the game's overall aesthetic.

19680,"[h1]Setting[/h1]
I have not played the first game. Therefore Alice: Madness Returns starts off in a somewhat strange situation. Yet the at the same time the protagonis can barely remember her past and I merely joined in on the amnesia. With regular switches between the dark, bleak reality and Alice's twisted wonderland, the story unravels on multiple levels. By the last two chapters I was more intrigued by the upcoming conclusion rather than the actual gameplay. A truely impressive feat for a game that consists of 95% gameplay. Without spoiling too much, the unique twisted wonderland with all of its disturbing imagery and the surrounding story make for an unforgettable setting.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
While Alice is just a poor, insane girl without any skills but walking in real life, she turns into an instoppable killing machine equiped with a knife, a pepper-grinder machine-gun, a toy horse battle-hammer and a teapot mortar. Floating, multi-jumps, timebombs that also activate pressure plates and a shrinking ability to squeeze through hidden passage ways, Alice has all the tools she needs for any combat encounter or platforming puzzle.
The platforming puzzles themselves are mostly straight forward, but can be challenging at times. Yet I never got stuck for more than a few minutes. The tougher ones feel appropriately gratifying after completion.
Combat is theoretically engaging as every enemy has a way or two to expose weak points, but is otherwise reistant to most weapons. Yet the combat suffers from one major problem, which I will get back to in the next section: target locking.

While the basic gameplay is great, engaging and fun, the game is riddled with insanely bad design decisions. At every parting of ways, the player is left wondering. Is one of them a dead end containing collectibles? Are both ways alternatives to the same destination? Or is there only one way forward? Usually that would not be a problem in a game about exploration, yet levels are swarmed by points of no return. Every doorway, every jump can lock you out from going back without warning. Thus collecting everything without a guide is basically impossible, unless you want to rerun chapters multiple times.
These points of no return can also be triggered by gathering a quest item or killing enemies. This means that you have to explore every room with enemies attacking you, if you don't want the game to consider a room completed and literally teleport you out and close the door behind you. You might even see a collectible or hidden passage during the little cutscene that kicks you out.
Then again, once you give in to the madness that is this horrbile design choice, once you just don't care about collectibles anymore, every one you find becomes a nice little surprise, instead of others being missed opportunities. Maybe that's what the developers had in mind in the first place.

[h1]Camera[/h1]
That one is so bad, it deserves its own section. During most of the gameplay the player can control the camera and it works perfectly fine. But everytime the game takes control, things fall apart.
There are small sections where the camera jumps to a corner to display the whole room. Unfortunately the controls don't make that jump and still act like the camrea is following you. Once you push a button, though, the controls suddenly realize that they should behave diffently according to the camera position. This means you shuffle to the collectible like an idiot, running into walls headfirst. At least until you realize that you can simply swing your blade once to reset the controls.
Then there are ""2D"" sections. They control horribly throughout.
Last but not least, there is combat. Target lock is the worst I have ever seen. The camera merely tries to keep you and the locked enemy on screen, instead of looking over the shoulder at the enemy. This leads to so many awkward camera angles that it's unplayable. Switching the locked target is also a game of chance rather than a precise act, and locking on targets out of view simply does not happen. Everytime there are multiple enemies involved, you will find yourself attacked from out of sight by enemies with ranged attacks. You will have to unlock the target, move the camera manually and lock again. As a cherry on top, you can only block while locked on a target. The same button allows you to jump, meaning you cannot do that while locked on the target. Horrible design, plain and simple. Alice: Madness Returns shows its true horror with the worst camera handling I have encountered since Legacy of Kain: Defiance.

[h1]Performance[/h1]
Mostly stable and smooth, but with occasional sutters and crashes. Completely unplayable with rythm puzzles, though. It's just a little 2d animation where you have to push buttons once the line hits them, but the processing is so unstable that I have simply skipped every single one of those puzzles after a few tries. The developers knew what horrible mess they were producing when they introduced that skip function.

[h1]Aesthetics[/h1]
God damn, is it beautiful. Yes, it is bizarre and unsettling and depressing, but the designs are so intriguing and unique, that you just can't take your eyes off. The age somewhat shows, but the art style easily makes up for it. Every chapter is a feast for the eyes and Alice gets a matching dress to go along with it.

[h1]Female Protagonist[/h1]
Speaking of dresses: I have to address this topic here. In our own sick and twisted reality where people seriously discuss how much of a natural hip sway caused by female anatomy is appropriate for a female protagonist like Aloy, Alice is a breath of fresh air - even though released 12 years ago. When she walks, jumps, twirls and floats, every move she makes is distinctly feminine. Butterflies accompany her in the air and when she dodges, she even blinks in a massive explosion of butterflies. The way she moves her hands while walking or positions her arms and legs when gliding are girly yet elegant. And so are the dresses. Every one has a sick little twist, but they are gorgeous nontheless. She even talks like a proper british lady - unless she goes into an eloquent rant. Alice is as feminine as protagonists get, yet she becomes a total badass in combat - and players root for her even more once she takes that badassness into reality for the ending.
I miss those days when female protagonists were actual girls with impressive skills and not just toxic men with boobs. Can we have more Alices in the future, please?

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
The game is great for the most part. The camera is jarring all the way to the final boss, but the other aspects of the game more than make up for it.

19680,"At first my emotions regarding this game were mixed.

The game crashed 1-3 times whenever I tried to load a save file. 
The game froze like 2 times in total. 
At times the game felt older than it actually was, something felt off about the texture and empty space.
The pacing felt too slow,I feel like the game could have been shorter, some sections dragged out/repeated too much. 

Yet I kept playing for the little things. The outfits that changed every chapter, hair physics, creative gameplay, interesting plot that was slowly being uncovered, the music, the sections of the game that looked beautiful and unique. 

By the end of chapter 6 I was glad that I bought and played this game to the end. 
I also now share the disapointment of people regarding the cancellation of Alice Asylum. I would love to see a bit more modernised version of Alice.
Yet I feel satisfied with how the game ended.

I would reccomend this game to people that are looking for a platformer with puzzles, mini games, collectibles and fighting.",True,7

Weapons that were used in the right time, the only problem is that the Stg44 looks like Mkb, but i dont care because it saw action as well. But the best thing about germans is this - they have different uniforms based on the location - Granadiers, Falshimjagers, SS. Not only soldiers, but also tanks - Stug 3 G and Panzer IV. No Tiger and that is no mistake my friends. Also altilery is against you - and by that i mean the bad 88. And dont worry, you can get a tank in some missions as well - Stuart, good old sherman and Wolverine (This tank existed and was used in France). The story is (for me personaly) better then in the Road to Hill 30. This time you play as Joe Hartsock. HE IS FAR BETTER THEN Baker. He knows who saved them at the Hill 30 spoiler! It was Legget and not Baker. And he doenst blame himself if someone dies, but accualy nobody died under his commands unlike under Bakers command. The story has good drama and damn is fokin well written. Enough for the story. Find it on your own. Next - now you can play a singleplayer skirmish angainst ai germans or americans and they arent that stupid. And yes you can play as germans - as Wermacht and not SS.

Doesn't work from Steam, requires 3rd party files

Enemy AI godtier aimbots
Auto-aim still on despite being off in the menu
Unforgiving mechanics and damage system
Taking damage stun-locks you
Getting stuck in doors after opening them

Overall, the game has a ton of potential but it's heavily bogged down by how unrelentingly moronic the AI is. I don't know why but I cannot turn off the aim assist, despite it saying ""OFF"" in the options screen, which further complicates the risky nature of the game. Couple that with missing point blank shots in auto or burst while the enemy can clap you in 2 hits. If just a few issues were ironed out, starting with making the thing playable off Steam, it could be a masterpiece.

It really pains me to give this a negative review. The fundamentals are there but the friendly AI is just too stupid. If this was about the potential of the game, definite 10/10.

Look up on youtube how to install all of the latest mods because i'm telling you its totally worth it.

Along with all of those weapons there is a slew of Optics from Eotechs to Thermal scopes, various IR and visible laser aiming systems, Surefire, Sig Sauer and Knights armament suppressors, all kinds of real world Special Operations kit. There are also some great character skins available. The expansions which are available with the mods give you a great variety of missions to choose from too. For $10 bucks! Get this game and mod it!! it doesn't take away from the experience it only makes a great thing even greater. On another note, the AI Teammates are easy to command and control and often times take out the enemy before I notice them.

This review is for the base game and the two expansions(Athena Sword + Iron Wrath)

The level design,sound and the gameplay is very good for its time .The graphics show their age, but the level design and environments are well-detailed and the rendering details are bit more improvised in the expansion packs.

Game is literally very hard in elite difficulty and AI is very response where careful planning and execution is required to progress and game cannot be saved in middle of the mission in any difficulty mode.The expansions add new missions, weapons and plot but the plot is similar to the base game . 

Overall, Rainbow Six 3 Gold and its expansions are very good standard tactical shooter games with unique tactical experience of it era.

Iron Wrath expansion is not included in steam.So, to play the expansion,follow the below guide :

19900,"The only Farcry game that isn't a power fantasy with a copy-pasted, uninteresting open world where nothing happens. The 'buddy' system is quite interesting and allows for far more replayability. The animations for the game look quite good and have a lot of effort put into them, despite being a game from 15 years ago the graphics look very good and the fire is the greatest ever made. 

The game features weapon jamming and degradation which requires you to carefully think when in combat as at any moment it could jam and it takes a while to unjam your gun if you don't like weapon jamming you can upgrade your gun to reduce the odds or you can also replace your gun at any time after buying it once from the gun store. In terms of combat, it is quite good though the enemies are bullet spongey and take a couple of headshots to kill,
you can shoot through most cover.

Stealth is an option however, it is only useful for getting an advantage in combat. 
The weapon variety is good as there are 12 primary weapons, 9 secondary weapons and 7 special weapons, some weapons are straight upgrades to others like the G3 vs the AK-47 others are sidegrades like the PKM vs the Flame-thrower vs the RPG-7.

It also feels less polished than the other games, far cry 3 or later feels more steadily satisfying to play, this game feels frustrating to play most of the time but occasionally you will completely annihilate an area and its all the more satisfying because that's not how things go for you constantly. In that way far cry 2 is more immersive and rewarding when you win. I once challenged myself by beating this entire game on infamous difficulty with only the homeland 37 shotgun that you buy at the very beginning just to see if it was possible. Surprisingly it was only a little harder than my previous playthroughs on lower difficulties and without erronous weapon restrictions. Thats what led me to my conclusion that the difficulty doesnt change much.

It's quite frustrating - the dull brown colour palette, the endless fucking malaria attacks, the limited fast travel options, the endlessly respawning enemy outposts (To name a few of my grievances)

Now I play Far Cry 2 with the ""Realism+Redux"" mod. The graphics are somehow prettier, the game is colourful/vibrant, the enemy outpost respawns are dialled down somewhat and I can save the game anywhere.

Unfortunately ""Realism+Redux"" doesn't stop the malaria, so I dug around the modded game files and modded them a little further. I give you ""Realism+Redux but with no malaria""

Normally I would give this expansion a 'Not Recommended' rating but since a [b]'Complete Pack'[/b] exists I highly advice that you buy the aforementioned Pack to have the full Company of Heroes 1 experience.

[h1]TL:DR? See Conclusion[/h1]

[h1]INTRODUCTION:[/h1]
Company of Heroes: Tales of Valor is a real-time strategy game developed by Relic Entertainment and published by THQ (RIP). This game serves as the second official expansion pack to the series which adds new game types that focuses on micro-management of either a single or small unit sizes, new 'Direct Fire' ability, new mini-campaigns which rewards you with alternate unit models for certain factions and fun new multiplayer modes.

The expansion pack 'Tales of Valor' gives the players three new mini-campaigns. The first one is 'Tiger Ace' which lets the players control a rampaging Tiger I Tank in a small town. The story follows the exploits of Majorgeneral Voss (character from Opposing Fronts) and Hauptmann Schultz (main antagonist of the first game). The second mini-mission is 'Causeway' where the player takes command of a group of paratroopers of the 86nd Air Division in their efforts to secure and hold the La Fiere Causeway which was being used by Allied forces to pass through the Normandy beaches. The last and final mini-mission is 'Falaise Pocket' where the player controls a renegade SS Panzergrenadiers and Wehrmacht soldiers who were ordered to evacuate but defied High Command in order to hold off advancing allied forces and give time for retreating German troops to escape.

[h1]PROS:[/h1]
+ New missions are fun to play
+ New units looks nice but... (See CON # 2)
+ New and fun multiplayer game modes like 'Stonewall'
+ Micromanagement gameplay (specially with the 'Tiger Ace' mission) was very fun
+ 'Falaise Pocket' mission was extreme
+ Artwork cutscenes were nice and complemented with good voice acting

[h1]CONS:[/h1]
- No new armies or units
- Some new units are just skin replacements
- Mini-campaigns can be completed in a few hours for all three missions (I didn't expect it to be as long as the original campaign or as long as the Opposing Fronts campaign but I didn't imagine that it was this short)
- The 'Directed Fire' feature is very hard to use and is implemented badly
- Tried to do Stealth missions which were implemented (just like the above CON) badly
- This expansion feels rushed

[h1]CONCLUSION:[/h1]
Much like a Sherman to a Tiger Tank, this expansion is vastly inferior to the other games. It has its moments with some really intense battles particularly the 'Falaise Pocket' campaign, interesting new game mechanics from 'Tiger Ace' and cool looking replacement units but in the end, it doesn't really add anything innovative to the title. Playing through the campaign missions will leave players feeling that this expansion was rushed and released prematurely.

Normally I would give this expansion a 'Not Recommended' rating but since a 'Complete Pack' exists I highly advice that you buy the aforementioned pack to have the full Company of Heroes 1 experience.

20540,One of the greatest games ever made.,True,48
20540,"Compared to the first expansion to Company of Heroes (Opposing Fronts), Tales of Valor adds very little. There are no new factions. There are no new, extensive campaigns. The expansion adds only three short, unfulfilling campaigns, some new multiplayer units (these replace other units normally in the game), and a few new multiplayer modes. The campaigns are not very fun. They entail taking control of a small number of absurdly overpowered units to play a highly unrealistic set of missions. The new units in multiplayer are generally less useful than the units they replace, so it's best to simply not use most of them. The survival multiplayer mode is fun, but it is not worth the purchase price of the game.

This expansion sometimes goes on sale for $2.50. If you're going to buy it, buy it at that price. Do not spend more than that on this expansion, as its gameplay value does not merit such.",False,41
20540,"Needless to say, Company of Heroes is one of the greatest games of all time and my favourite RTS. If you are interested in this game and haven't bought it yet, let me just sum up all the things which make Company of Heroes so superb: 

+ thrilling campaign with cinematic cutscenes
+ insane multiplayer battles where even a certain loss can be turned into a surprising victory
+ unique resource system that forces you to play aggressively and fight across the entire map
+ completely destroyable environment and sophisticated physics system
+ very detailed graphics compared to other RTS games

With that being said, one could think CoH is almost a perfect game. It indeed is, but there is also a couple of things that sometimes make the game a bit frustrating:

- vehicle pathing. Especially in urban maps with lots of buildings. obstacles, etc.
- cheating AI. Yes, computer player cheats which means it can see the exact locations of all your units at all times as well as your building queues. Additionally, it can also use some abilities in ways human players can't.

So, what are you waiting for? Go get the game if you haven't yet! It's definetely worth the money and it still has a lot to offer, even today.

9/10",True,36
20540,"The only thing that bugs me about this game, is that there is nothing wrong with it. The second add-on to one of best real-time strategy games of all time. Intense, beautiful, and very amazing. The Game follows the stories of individuals from both sides as they fight in the Battle of Normandy. This add-on, does not have the average long campaign stories. But three short, but very good stories. Two German and One American. Either you are a German Tiger Ace batting British Tanks, and German Luftwaffe Ground Unit trying to defend the evacuation of the Faliase Gap, or a small band of members of the 82nd Airborne Division trying to hold a key road from a German counter-attack on D-Day. New units and better graphics are added making your whole Company of Heroes series (Opposing Fronts, and ToV) a whole lot better and more exciting.",True,28
20540,"Company of Heroes: Tales of Valor (CoH: ToV) is another expansion from the ground-breaking real-time strategy (RTS) game, Company of Heroes. CoH: ToV, however, does not offer any new armies and features a very short campaign, but it does allow you to select a few new units in multiplayer that will replace other units such as the American M10 Tank Destroyer for the M18 Hellcat. CoH: ToV is still a worthwhile investment for fans and completionists while still offering interplay ability.",True,22
20540,by far the first company of heroes is still the better than the 2nd . and there are more choice and mod in the first company of heroes,True,15
20540,"I recommend this only if you get the bundle, BUT, Tales of Valor by itself not worth the price. I'm a huge die hard fan of Company of Heroes and Opposing Fronts. Opposing fronts does add so much to the original, but for some reason THQ felt the need to release this expansion without much to include so NO  do not get this game by itself you will be extremely disappointed and ripped off. Get all three in the bundle and damn it, it's one of the greatest RTS titles to grace the PC world 10/10. Graphics still hold up this day, and it makes you feel like you're playing straight out of Saving Private Ryan.",True,12

20550,"A reasonably short and decent enough sci-fi shooter with terrible, spongy boss fights. It's also a huge disappointment after the first, much weirder, Red Faction game. It keeps the destructability from the original, but nowhere near as much of it. It's more polished, but much more boring. Worth getting on sale.",True,1

20570,"This is a controversial opinion, but I think this is probably the best story in the DOW series. Don't get me wrong: original DOW, Winter Assault, DOW 2, and Retribution are all pretty solid stories and Dark Crusade beats it in gameplay, but there's just something about Chaos Rising that hits different.

It is a bit more slow paced than HON but oh my it is still much fun with great abilities and spells. Personaly I think LOL is a bit more balanced than HON because no matter what character you get you can become strong and powerfull, unlike HON where you have to be a carry to really get buffed in the late game.

Overall I would say if you got some time to spare and you like HON or DOTA you should check this out, it is free and really fun=)",True,0
20700,"Played this one before the days of Steam, back when the game was advertised on websites as a banner ad. A classic indie game that deserves a whole lot more attention and love than it got.

Starts off a bit slow with a bit too much dialog I'll admit, but give it time and be patient, and after a while it becomes a really addictive and fast paced action/strategy game. It's like, if Asteroids had an open-ish map where while you're fighting stuff and mining resources in one location, the enemies are doing the same in other locations and taking away your potential resources to build better ships and guns and stuff.

Also, the character art looks like something from deviantART. However, the ships and gameplay graphics look great! It has aged fairly well (but be warned that the max resolution is 800x600 with no widescreen modes!!)

More people need to know about this game. So... go play it or somethin'!",True,53
20700,"Awesome game. Makes for a decent 4X style game. Can't really expand your ownings, but can research and ugprade equipment, explore the place, mine materials to improve your odds.
Very very fun, got 21 hours into it and a year later I'm coming back to play some more!",True,25
20700,"I have seen this game ten years ago.  I bought it about five years ago from a non-Steam service and promptly lost the ability to play it.  I saw it up on a flash sale and promptly bought it.  It is a testament to the game that it's imagery stayed prominent for so long with me.  Either way, the game is SPAZ before SPAZ existed.  Do not buy it expecting the same polish from a game with a decade of tech advancement inbetween.  That said, it's a fun romp through space mining resoruces, builing tech and blasting aliens.
Story is shaping up decent for the first hour of game too.  We'll see where it goes.",True,22
20700,"This is actually a really fun game at first, when you are first upgrading and manipulating your ship.  You can make missile boats, blaster-based ships, you get option drones to fire when you shoot, and so on.  Mining is actually somewhat interesting to fool around with early on. 

It, however, gets repetitive, starting with mining, and then upgrading, and finally the combat.  The final ship components cause all end-game ships to look the same, and the final boss has a stupid mechanic which requires you to either have a way more responsive ship than the game gives you, or to angle a shot in a way that gives you a generally unsatisfying win because you didn't do the high-agility maneuvers that it feels like you should do.  It caps the game off with not even allowing you to have a solid victory in the final ""cutscene.""

Overall, a good 75% of a game marred by an overly repetitive final zone.  If you don't mind this, and the late 90s graphics, go ahead and get it!  It's actually pretty fun, reminiscent of Asteroids with an upgradeable ship and uh, better graphics, though still a far cry from anything you'd call ""modern.""",False,15
20700,"This older game is a more modern take on the classic Asteroids platform. Shoot asteroids, suck up all the resources, use those resources for research and development against aliens, yes aliens!

It's showing it's age with the limited 2D art styles, but as a quick and easy pick-up-and-play for only US$10, it's quite worth the price of admission, especially with the sheer availability you will have on Steam.",True,11
20700,"Interesting mix of shoot'em-up bullet hell games and 4X strategy. You can explore the Universe, fight through thousands of various enemy units, research new technologies, build a lot of stuff and experience the storyline, something that 4X games usually lack. The music is awesome, too.
However, the storyline itself is somewhat shallow, character depth is nonexistent, and the game only runs at 640x480 and 800x600, forcing you to play in Windowed mode, if you have a 16:9 monitor.
Overall, it's a great game, which I played for around 30 hours outside of Steam, and 13 more hours here. It's not worth the full price of 10 dollars/euros, because it's outdated, but you should definitely grab it during the sale.",True,10
20700,"Even without the underlying story of fighting aliens, it's surprisingly fun to just shoot at asteroids and collect minerals.",True,9
20700,"Killed some time with this back in college, but it's pretty meh.  Collect resources, upgrade your mothership and your fightercraft, research and build...but the mechanics don't come together, it feels shallow, the interface is a pain, and it doesn't do bigger than 800x600.  The concept isn't flawed, it's just too small: the mechanics would have been fine in a shorter game, a flash game, that kind of thing, but stretched out to full-game length it suffers.  This game doesn't need a strategic map, but you have to slog through it anyway.  Worst of all is that it caps what you're allowed to research pretty aggressively, so early in the game you're sitting on max levels of resources that you can't spend.  Way to identify the fun part of the game and then kick it like a puppy, guys.

I still have fond memories of this game though, mainly from one night when I heard the starbase alarm going off, said ""Hey wait my mothership is still at full health"", and realized it was my next door neighbor playing at full volume.

Verdict:  Go play Tyrian instead.  That's what you really wanted anyway.",False,5
20700,"Ah Starscape... what's not to love?

Space shooter? Nice.

Physics based handling? Not bad.

Upgradable ship designs? Pretty good!

Lots of semi-interesting characters with a less than vomit-inducing plot? Not great, but it could be worse.

So... what's not to love? Why's this a thumbs down vote?

Well... here's the rub: the handling on your ships is very realistic, but it's slow and clunky. I'm alright with that, normally. It requires some planning of momentum and some good piloting to be competent, and that's fine.

The problem is that the boss battles aren't designed for the controls nor the physics of the game. They assume perfect, pristine, pin-point keyboard turning in rapid order. I'm fine with that if the interface made such a realistic possibility. Unfortunately, starscape's boss battles are like waltzing into the olympics' figure skating event wearing cross country skiis.

It doesn't matter how good you are, the controls simply flat out SUCK for trying to fight the bosses, and player skill seriously only has a very small amount to do with it. Someone with godlike reflexes could theoretically get through in a few tries, but most of your boss battles involve being expected to start moving out of the way before a boss even begins to box you in, without knowing when or where that attack will come from. If your ship were even remotely possible to be set up to cope with that, great, but it's not.

Keyboard turning and physics-based thrust maneuvering simply doesn't work for the style of bosses that Starscape throws at you.

The rest of the game is fun and fine, a few minor nitpicks here and there, but it's good overall... but the act-ending bosses are mandatory, and they suck HARD. I don't mean ""it's difficult"", I mean it in the sense of ""this is one of the worst design decisions I've ever seen anyone ever make... did they even play test this to see if it was fun?"".

Any fun you get from the game will be sucked dry as soon as you're stuck in a boss battle, and since the controls and interface flat out aren't up to the task of fighting the bosses, it's going to make you pull your hair out over it. I highly advise staying the hell away from Starscape just in general. Unless you're a masochist, then go right ahead.

Anyway, to stress it again, there's a difference between ""difficult"" and ""bad design and poor UI/controls"". Having a piss poor interface does not equate to ""difficulty"", it just equates to being BAD.




Final Verdict:

Not worth it, even if it's on sale for $1. You'll probably break a keyboard that cost more than $1, even if you don't have a history of such, and are a pretty mellow person normally. While the game has lots of really good points to it, and does a lot of stuff very well, it's flaws are gamebreaking. When you put more effort into fighting the game's interface than you do fighting the boss, the game's a bust.


Score: About 35%. It has some really good stuff, but the flaws are devastating and overpower any potential the game had.",False,4
20700,Interesting [i]Bosconian / Asteroids[/i] space-mining crossover.,True,4
20710,"A nice little indie production that creates an alloy of traditional JRPG and puzzle solving in the spirit of games such as Solstice for the NES.

The exploration and puzzle solving all takes place inside the massive space ship. As a maintenance droid the player possesses no weapons to defend himself and has to overcome adversity by problem solving and navigation skills. Some of the jumping puzzles can be agrevating but nothing that feels unfair. 

The combat system comes into play whenever a security door or an opponent needs to be hacked. The electronic avatar of the player character Asimov possesses the capability to attack the security measures of the system he hacks. Over the course of his adventures he rescues a vide range of avatars that has lost their robotic bodies. They complement Asimovs Jack-of-all-Trades skills with their specialities. 

There is not much innovation about the combat compared to some of the more popular Japanese RPGs out there but it does it job well and achieves enough strategic depth for the entertainment value in a product of this size. 

The way the game is set up it is possible to solve many puzzles forcefully by hacking most of the opposition making the actual puzzle solving alot easier. A welcome function for players that dont favour jumping skills or the puzzles them selves.

[b]mr. robot[/b] is definitely one of the least-known gems around. it's an isometric puzzle/platform/rpg. you move your robot around with slightly floaty controls (one of the methods works better than the other) and jump around collecting stuff, pushing crates to make way or avoid hazards, etc. and ultimately try to save your robot friends, who slowly join you and make fights easier, especially if you equip them properly with upgrades and programs.

the rooms on the spaceship (oh yeah, you're on a spaceship, humans are in cryo-sleep and the ai's gone mad, of course) are puzzly and platformy, sometimes timing is required to avoid things or make a jump, and when you hack terminals, you'll get the chance to grab loot and weaken the ai via turn-based combat.

progress can be saved at save points but it's not too much of a bother to get back to the nearest one occasionally and there's a demo if you're uncertain. it's not a pure puzzler, but that's what I love about it (and I'm sure that's what's gonna turn some people off). if it didn't have the hacking/combat, I would've passed on it probably, as I'm not that good at platforming, but the whole package was a lot of fun to play through (ignore my playtime, I played it in offline mode). kinda like a match-3 game with meta-progression, more appealing than just matching and getting a higher score.

the level editor isn't included in the Steam version and I don't think you can play user-made levels found on the  [url=http://www.moonpod.com/board/viewforum.php?f=23&sid=4c80044c0b29cb15a68eded9f9a384af]official forum[/url] either, but the game itself is definitely worth your attention.",True,9
20710,"While I appreciated and enjoyed the 3D isometric platforming aspect of the game (which was admittedly the majority of the game), it's dragged down horribly by an utterly one-dimensional, boring, repetitive RPG-type combat system, as well as an uninspired storyline chock full of sci-fi clichés. While I was able to look past its flaws enough to finish a playthrough of the game, in hindsight, as a whole, it's not a game I would recommend.",False,8
20710,"It's a cute little turn based RPG with a charming story involving robots that have just enough AI as to exude personality in the way WALL-E's robot characters did.  The fighting moves have just enough variation, and anyone that's played a JRPG in the last 20 years will have no trouble identifying the ""physical,"" ""magical"" and ""AoE"" moves.  There are some places where you can choose to grind up character stats by revisiting enemies in cyberspace if needed, but you also seem to be able to pursue the story without being gated.  The ""maze"" of the ship and platforming are interesting without being overwhelming.  The combat has a bit of a Shadowrun inspired feel to it which will make you grin with nostalgia.

For a cheap little indie RPG it's fun.  It's not going to blow your mind, but for a casual time waster it does the job splendidly, hearkening back to simpler times.  Sometimes you just need a break from modern real time RPGs that require 100% of your focus and engagement, and this game understands that.",True,7

The turn based fighting sections honestly did start to wear on me after a while. And I usually like simple RPGs, but these fights were so easy that it just became monotonous. I beat the final boss in three turns for crying out loud. Maybe it would have been better if I played on hard, I don't know. This isn't too much of a problem though since you can just opt to avoid fights if you want.
The story and the puzzle sections made the game for me. It's got a really neat sort of singularity type of story that I've never seen in a game before. And I like how you learn more about the characters as the game progresses.
The platforming sections I liked the most, I just wish there were more of them.

The game gives the player really good rugby match atmosphere, the stadiums look realistic and before every match begins, if you're playing on a national team, the national anthem will play for each team while you're looking at the player line-ups. If you're using or playing against the All Blacks, you even get to see their haka before the match begins. If you made a try while being tackled down etc, the referee will make decisions by looking at video replay, just like in the real match.

20900,"When I first played The Witcher, I was in middle school and I had pirated the game. Like most middle schoolers, I wasn’t very smart and the only thing I really looked for in a game was how many bad guys I could murder. I finished the game and quickly forgot about it. Only after I was in college did I realize to the full extent the awful choices that I had made during my first playthrough of The Witcher. My crimes were beyond description. I killed street dogs and innocent travelers just to loot 2 orens worth of stuff from their corpses. I slept with women and promptly abandoned them to be murdered by angry mobs or overzealous knights. I killed a fellow witcher. I walked away from a chance to have a happy family with a woman who loved me in order to sleep with my sex buddy sorceress who I thought looked hotter. I helped commit mass genocide, murdering dozens of non-humans fighting for freedom.

By chance I happened to see The Witcher: Enhanced Edition on sale during Steam Summer Sale 2014. I took it as a sign from heaven. Lord Gaben the Redeemer was speaking to me through my computer, offering me a chance to atone for my sins of the first playthrough. Now I could do what I had not done in middle school. I would uphold justice and help the weak. I would be the hero that Vizima needed, but not the one it deserved. And I could do it with 75% off.

20900,"I got this game on a sale for 1.49 EUR and it was the best deal ever, it turned out to be amazing. It's not for everyone however, as it's quite long, you need to pay attention to the story and get used to the clunky combat - you'll either love it or give up in the first few hours.

I started the game to see what it's like, struggled with the fighting, played half an hour until it suddenly crashed and I realised I didn't save the game. I didn't really like what I saw first, but I decided to give it another chance. Fortunately, the dialogues are skippable, so I could continue almost immediately and this time I read the tutorial more attentively and managed to find out how to properly kill enemies. As the story progressed, I got more and more into it and started to enjoy the game very much.


[u][h1]Graphics[/h1][/u]
Even though the game came out in 2007, it's beautiful. The environments are detailed, colourful and interesting, most places are not just visually but aesthetically pleasing. Heck, even some dark crypts and caves look exquisite here and there due to the nice colours and great lighting.


[u][h1]Gameplay[/h1][/u]
When you start the game, you have to choose a style you want to play it in, and you still have the opportunity to change this anytime. You can have an isometric camera or OTS, so you can play point and click style, and also in third person if you want to (I chose the latter). Being inexperienced with RPGs, I played on easy. My character became pretty strong eventually (maybe too strong for this difficulty), yet there still were a few challenging parts to balance that out.

As you play, you gain XP and level up. While meditating, you can access the skill tree, which looked a bit complicated at first, but it makes perfect sense. Alchemy is pretty useful, especially for bigger fights, I haven't used any bombs though.

The gameplay is not particularly interesting on its own, the story is what makes it special. Sometimes there's a lot of running back and forth, collecting things, which gets boring after a while. I was very grateful for the few fast travel options we got.

On the other hand, there are lots of side quests to keep you busy. Some of them are of the general [i]collect-this-and-I-reward-you[/i] tpye, and there are more important ones as well. Some side quests enrich the story [i]a lot[/i] and have an overall impact on how you experience it, so it's definitely worth completing those.


[u][h1]Combat[/h1][/u]
It's doubtless that this is the low point of the game. The first time I saw Geralt grabbing a sword and swinging it around above his head like an idiot, I laughed out loud, I thought it was a bug. (Later though as I applied more talents on the swords, he became a much better fighter.) To evade attacks you need to dodge by pressing one of the direction buttons twice or more times, depending on how responsive it wants to be in the current situation, I had some trouble sometimes when Geralt got cornered. To attack, you need to click on the enemy and do not click again immediately, doing so will cancel the attack. Only click again when the cursor changes, allowing you to do combos if you click in time. It definitely takes some getting used to.

Collect as much information as you can on the enemies you have to face, it's important to read the Journal, especially the pages on Monsters to learn what they're immune to, where they can be found, which fighting styles are efficient against them. It helps you a great deal. The Signs are very useful and fun, too.

The controls during combat are pretty awkward sometimes, even if I had the right fighting style selected, I couldn't attack or hurt the enemies. I had to switch to another style and then back for it to decide to work again.


[u][h1]Story[/h1][/u]
After the low point, here comes the best part. The story in this game is [b]incredible[/b]. It's very detailed, very deep and exciting. The dialogues are filled with humour and deep philosophical thoughts here and there.

The world is consistent, the characters are likeable and unique, after a while you find yourself caring about many of them. They all respond to your actions and choices. There's quite a number of decisions you have to make that (sometimes pretty heavily) affect the story and your relationship to certain characters. I loved the amount of freedom I had in the game, I was never forced to get in an intimate relationship with any character or play dice, etc. - it's entirely up to the player.

The way women were portrayed though - boobs, boobs and more boobs. I've seen more boobs in this game than my own. :P Jokes aside, I simply had to play very carefully when others were in the same room with me, because almost every woman you can interact with is um... underdressed. Good for Geralt I guess. ;)

As you play more and more, the story just drags you in - even if you don't like the combat or the gameplay, it's definitely worth to play this through just for the story alone.


[u][h1]Animation and voices[/h1][/u]
This is something I wasn't entirely pleased with. Yes, it's not a game from today, but the characters often looked very stiff, which is not a good thing when there's a lot of dialogue. Another thing which detracts from the experience is the mediocre voice acting. First I found it very awkward, but got used to it eventually and after a certain point it simply didn't bother me anymore.
(I kept finding the same character models throughout the game though, now that did annoy me a bit.)


[u][h1]Music and atmosphere[/h1][/u]
The music was pretty great, fast paced and dark when needed, beautiful and calming while exploring beautiful areas. It really spiced some great moments up. Same with the atmosphere, the time of day really sets the mood of some locations, as well as the occasional rain and storms.
I also loved the art style, there's some gorgeous artwork during storytelling parts.


[u][h1]Summary:[/h1][/u]
+ nice visuals
+ amazing story with brilliant dialogues
+ great music and atmosphere

- combat might be hard to get used to
- bad animations


It took me 46 hours to finish the adventure and it's become one of my all-time favourite games. If you can get used to the combat and want to take a break from no-brainers, I highly recommend The Witcher, it's going to be an amazing and unforgettable experience.",True,1054

20900,"The Witcher is an action role playing hack and slash game developed by CD Projeckt RED and published by Atari – being released on PC in late 2007. This is the first game in the Witcher Series. 

The gameplay in Witcher a split between focusing on the hack and slash, and the other on the heavy dialogue scenes. The game can be played in one of three camera angles, there are two top down angels, and one over the shoulder view – I mainly used the third person view as it suited the gameplay more than the others.  Combat in this game is something that sometimes receives criticism but I found it to be a nice change from the regular combat you see in RPGs – you have three different styles of attack, a quick, heavy and group attack – each of these attacks have three stages of attack and you have to click at the right time in order to continue your combo of attack. This does feel a little like a QTE, but for me it is disguised well enough that you don’t really notice it. The Witcher also comes equipped with two different main weapons – one sword which deals more damage to monsters, but is less effective against humans, and another weapon which is the opposite. Another major portion of the gameplay is based on alchemy, you will be spending a lot time collecting herbs in order to make an assortment of potions in order to help you progress.  This is one of the first games I have played that your actions really do have a massive impact on how the story flows and concludes. A lot of the dialogue options when conversing with other characters will also affect the story and how that character in particular interacts with the player.  

This game is eight years old now, so you would expect the graphics to be a little on the dated side, however when wracking the resolution up to 4k, the game still has a current gen look to it; whilst some of the textures may be on the lower quality scale still, the open worldness of the game means that you can’t really expect mind blowing graphics at the time of its development.  The game also has some very nice looking special effects, such as water effects. 

On release of Witcher, the game’s voice acting was supposedly one of the worst that has been seen, however the Enhanced Edition of the game, which everyone got who purchased the original version, greatly improves the voice acting to acceptable levels – whilst it is still not the best by today’s standards, every single character in the game is catered for and has a voice to be heard.  The game has a couple of sound tracks that are really iconic too, and the sound effects are all really on par. 

Witcher’s plot is one of my all-time favourites – it is very rare that a game is able to completely suck me into the story right from the word go. The game is split in to various chapters, which allows the game to create sub plots whilst also progressing the overall main story line at an acceptable pace. A lot of the quests in Witcher will bear no importance to the main story, and often are there to add an extra layer of depth to the world in which you are in. The immersion levels are sky high in this game as you will find yourself caring greatly for the characters.

This game comes with three levels of difficulties; Easy, Medium and Hard. I was playing on medium on my run through the game and was still challenged to the point where I had to replay a few parts due to death. Hard mode is seriously for the hard-core RPGers out there; you will need to take full advantage of the alchemy system in the game as most of the more advanced fights will 100% require the use of multiple potions. Your average Joe gamer will get a great amount of enjoyment and challenge from the medium settings though. 

Witcher is one of the longest games I have played. Having just finished the whole game with the majority of side quests, and exploring done, it has taken me eighty hours to complete. Although the replay ability in Witcher is quite high given you can change the middle part of the game and outcome quite heavily depending on how you act and play; you would seriously have to be a huge fan to want to be putting eighty hours into another play through. I am very happy with the longevity of the game; you cannot complain about a game this good having a huge amount of content available. 

Technically, the game is sound. I didn’t have any problems running the game at higher resolutions, with a fairly nice selection of graphic options available to optimize your game for your computer.  The game needs to be played with a keyboard and mouse though – there are mods which you can install for controllers but the gameplay really needs a mouse to be completely effective. 

In conclusion, The Witcher Enhanced Edition is easily one of the best games to ever been made and every RPG fan needs to experience it. The low regular price of £6, 99 makes this game an absolute must buy. It has been known to go as low as £1, 39…which you would have to be brain dead to not pick it up for that price. Eighty hours of stellar gameplay and amazing story line, makes The Witcher one of my top 5 games of all time.

I bought extra copies for all of my friends and family so they can experience the greatness that is this game.

20900,"[h1]The Witcher: Utterly brilliant, but rough and over-ambitious[/h1]

The first game in [i]The Witcher[/i] series has often been called a ""rough diamond"", so my title doens't tell anything new. This review was wrtten just a couple of days before the release of [i]The Witcher 3[/i], and without having played [i]The Witcher 2[/i] yet. This way I hope to be able to look at the original game in the series with fresh eyes, not with the hindsight of the other games somewhere in the back of my head. It's also important to notice that this review addresses the final release of the game, from september 2008, i.e. The ""Enhanced Edition: The Director's Cut"". This version represents the developers' final thoughts and ideas on the game, and it differs considerably from any other version.

In this game, the player takes the role of Geralt of Rivia, a witcher or a professional monster-slayer. There is no character-build menu, no fancy options about hair-colour or the width of your eyebrows. You are Geralt of Rivia, you are a Witcher. And to put it simple: the game is so utterly brilliant since it manages to let you believe that, almost from the start. Seldom have I felt so deeply connected to the character I was playing: after a couple of in-game hours, I started to think as Geralt, react to my surroundings as Geralt, even feel like Geralt: I was completely involved, the game got deep under my skin, I was bewitched. It's not that I played the game for hours and hours on end, or that I played through the night, no: it's more like I felt Geralt had become part of my life, not only while in-game, but also while not playing. I started to look for articles and websites to read about [i]The Witcher[/i] and its world, and I even dreamt a couple of times about the game and its characters...

[h1]The game's greatest strengths: the world, the story, the choices[/h1]

As is commonly known by now, the Polish developer CD Project Red started working on [i]The Witcher[/i] – actually their first game – out of love for the books, novels and stories by the Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski. Sapkowksi is the author of The Witcher-universe: a collection of books and stories about a fictional, fantasy-world with a profound background and a history all of its own. Sapkowski has often been called ""The Polish Tolkien"", and while that might be too big a compliment, I often felt like I was part of a world that could hold its own against Tolkiens incredible rich universe. And I suppose that explains why I felt so connected to the game and so deeply involved: the world of The Witcher did already exist before the game, and is completely coherent and believable by itself.

It is one thing to have an interesting world to build a game in, it's another to write and develop a story within this world that works well for a role-playing game. The story of [i]The Witcher[/i] however succeeds brilliantly in keeping the player's interest. It is ambitious, full of twists and unexpected turns, but it stays believable right up to the end. The different characters, both Geralt and his main protagonists, are complex and multi-layered: hardly anyone in this world is just ""good"" or ""evil"": most of the time, its a mix of both, often with one or several other characteristics  added. The game does a fantastic job in introducing the player (Geralt) to this world, using an old trick: after having lost his memory, Geralt has to rediscover not only the places, the stories and the people, but he has to rediscover himself: he has to give himself a place in the dark, conflict-ridden world he lives in.

The main way to do this, is by making choices: the game's strongest point by far is the feeling you get that the decisions you make actually matter, and do influence the flow and even the outcome of the story. This is especially impressive since almost every choice, from minor to very important, is difficult and hardly clear-cut. The games offers tons of dialogues, more than 5000 lines of text to be read and/or said, but very seldom did I feel like doing the ""good thing"". In most cases, the situation was so dire or the possible answers so gruff, that I had a hard job to make decisions that felt ""right"" at all. It was more like ""trying to do my best, and hoping for the best"", since often decisions or roads taken early in the game, proved to have unexpected consequences (much) later on. The way in which this game manages to make me think about good and evil, about morality and consequences, is utterly and completely brilliant.

[h1]The game's problem: it tries too hard to be the best rpg in the world[/h1]

From whatever angle you look at it, it is obvious that [i]The Witcher[/i] is a very, very ambitious game. The developers made no secret of it that, even back in 2007 when they were almost unknown, they wanted to make ""the best rpg ever"". Ambition definitely is a good thing for any developer, it can also be a trap. While CD Project Red succeeded brilliantly with everything story- and character-related, they paid dearly in some other departments. The actual gameplay, the movement and combat, form the game's biggest downfalls. As a matter of fact, lots of people have tried the game, only to leave it after running into frustration with the combat system. Combat is an exercise in rythmical feeling: by clicking at the right moment, Geralt can chain attacks together so that they become much stronger. Fast clicking is of no use whatsoever, as is blocking or parrying since the game takes care of that.

Moreover, Geralt has two different swords (steel for humans and animals, silver for monsters) and three differend combat styles (strong, fast and group style) at his disposal, so choosing the right weapon and the right sword for any fight is an important issue. Combat is much more tactical than in most rpg's, and since dozens of alchemical potions, lots of special coatings for either of your swords, six magical signs and even some bombs are thrown into the equation as well, it is very easy to get overwhelmed by this avalanche of ideas. Still, when one is prepared to play the game slow, with lots of attention to the myriad of entries in the journal (on quests, people, monsters, alchemical ingredients, recipes or locations), the sense of fulfillment can be enormous. This is most of all true of the alchemy, which is a very important part of the game. It takes a time to get the hang of it, when once mastered, it proves very rewarding.

[h1]Final thoughts[/h1]

Playing and mastering [i]The Witcher[/i] felt like climbing a mountain: it takes time, patience and commitment, even preparation, but once everything gets going, the long way to the summit becomes a joy by itself. In the case of the first game in the series, the mountain definitely is not Mount Everest nor even Mont Blanc, and the path is littered with dangerous spots and possible downfalls, but the scenery is gorgeous nonetheless, and the journey towards the summit proved one I won't ever forget.

Gameplay: 25/30 (provided one takes the time to master the combat system)
Graphics: 16/20 (the game looks brilliant for its age)
Sound: 8/10 (the music is fantastic, the voice-acting is not)
Technical stability: 9/10 (I got no crashes whatsoever with this final edition)
Steam integration: 7/10 (like any older game, it comes without cards or achievements)
Game for the money: 9/10 (it's a very long game, but it's not an open-world sandbox)
Personal appreciation: 10/10

Overall Score: 84/100",True,265
20900,"The Witcher manages to be one of the best RPGs that I have played in spite of many little flaws. There are times the game will frustrate you in minor ways, and yet the game deserves the cult classic status it enjoys. The story is dark and engaging,   the world is deep and lore filled, and the moral ambiguity will have you racked with doubt about the choices you have made. But make no mistake, you will make choices in this game, and you will have to bear the responsibility those choices bring.

20920,"First off, know that The Witcher 2 is not a game that will hold your hand. If you're thinking about purchasing this, know that to get the most out of this game you need to be prepared to fully immerse yourself in the experience and pay attention to what is going on. This a game which deals with many adult themes such as politics, racism and sex to deliver a mature and complex game supported by rich lore and stunning visuals. 

The writing and storytelling is exceptional throughout and the moral ambiguity and choices are second to none. The gameplay, in particular the combat, is an acquired taste but offers a refreshing level of depth and potential for improvisation when compared to games in a similar genre. Sound design and voice acting is also of high quality, with the environments coming to life through impressive visual and audio support and characters each sporting distinct personalities and prejudices.

It is also worth mentioning that if you have played the first Witcher game, your choices and gear will be reflected via an imported save in The Witcher 2, however the choices have limited effect and it is not necessary to play the first game to enjoy the second (however you will be at a slight disadvantage in some situations).

In my honest opinion the experience as a whole is unparalleled, and The Witcher 2 is easily the most enjoyable and immersive RPG I have played in recent memory. I would also advise reading the books by Andrzej Sapkowski as these offer an interesting insight into the protagonist's past. But back to the game, overall I would highly recommend The Witcher 2 to anyone with at least a passing interest in the RPG genre, it is the definition of a complete gaming package with spectacular production values and a lasting impression.",True,866
20920,"I recently finished Witcher 2 and throughouly enjoyed it, but make no mistake here, Witcher 2 is a superb game where it excels, but it fails laughably where it doesn't. It's not as shining a game as people praise it to be.

Pros:
+Story story story. I can't heap enough praise on this for the world, the story here is fantastic. Incredibly engaging and well thought out. This game is worth the price by this merit alone, it's that good
+Sidequests are all incredibly thought out and fleshed out, even the ones that seem token at first glance. From delving into a monster-infested cave to validate the claim of a suspected spy, to confronting a wraith accusing a soldier of murdering her family, it really goes all in. Even a quest chain revolving around an arm wrestling minigame ends up memorable.
+The choices you make actually make a huge impact on the story, the progression, the ending, everything. Most of the important choices actually made me take a step back for a few minutes to think over what I really wanted to do. It truly feels like you're the commanding force in where the story goes, rather then being along for the ride.

Cons:
-This game collapses under the sheer weight of gameplay mechanics it can not fully support given the game's relatively short length. Alchemy, potion drinking before combat, potion toxicity, weight system, subweapons, status resistances, ability mutating, persuasion methods, and a full crafting system are just a few I can list off the top of my head. All of these systems end up either pointless, or downright clunky and obstuse.
-The game operates at an absolutely draconian 24:1 buy/sell ratio for shops. Each shopkeeper sells items for a massive *twenty-four times* its worth. The game's entire economy is completely unworkable, as there is no methods for actually producing the sheer quantities of currency the game expects of you. It's completely broken.
-No fast travel. While, to be fair, the hubs are small and dense, you will be end up doing an annoying amount of backtracking through the same areas regardless. It gets grating.
-The game has over 100 abilities you can sink levels into. The problem is that the max level you can hit is a palty 35. Even focusing all of your possible level ups into one of the skill trees in isolation results in you barely scraping getting each skill leveled up. You will never hit ""max strength"", not even close to it.
-Killing monsters gives no tangible exp- all your exp gains come from quest completion; often 2-3 levels at a time, even. Since making money is also a winless game as well, this means any nonessential fights are better off just being ignored entirely, especially considering how difficult it is to restore health.
-The game expects you to drink potions before combat, but the game had a hard time telling when you are and are not in combat, as well as letting you know when a good time to potion up would be. The game only lets you drink potions outside of combat as well, a completly unneccessary restriction.
-The ai for friendly npcs you need to follow is atrocious. It is very rare that the ai doesnt randomly stop or get stuck on nothing. It's often easier to just ignore the person you're following and run there yourself, its often that bad.
-There is no clear indication of taking damage. There is a full battle log hidden in the bottom right corner where you would never be able to read it in the heat of battle, but that textbox is the only indication you have of whats going on. Fighting a group of enemies is especially aggravating, as you will often get swiped by the enemies you aren't targeting, taking a large chunk of health without so much as an ""ow"".
-A very wierd restriction of being unable to change keybindings outside of the main menu. Why is that a thing? No clue.

- CD Projekt Red announces Cyberpunk 2077. 
- I never played any of the Witcher games till then.
- ""Oh no gotta play Witcher 3 everyone's crazy about it""
- But I like a good story, can't skip Witcher 1 and 2.
- Play Witcher 1 - 40+ hours - dammit.
- Play Witcher 2 - 30+ hours and not really an open world but still an amazing story and totally into the characters - dammit.
- Play Witcher 3 - 50+ hours and not even finished 20% of the game - dammit.

👉 A major improvement to its predecessor, way more similar to The Witcher 3. Combat, for instance, is much more complex, with additions in the form of abilities to lay traps and aim and throw ranged weapons.
Upgrades are divided into four distinct paths : 
     - General
     - Swordsmanship
     - Magic (Signs)

If you played The Witcher 3 first, the combat system shouldn't disturb you.

Make sure to turn on V-SYNC though, because some of the mechanics arent functional without it. And some of the controls are a little clunky, but other than that this game has no problems.",True,1

21030,"Watchmen Part 1 was repetitive, but had a decent enough storyline and combat to justify playing for Watchmen fans. Part 2 has the same basic Beat-Em-Up gameplay, but manages to be more repetitive and overall worse. Just like in Part 1, the storyline itself is actually a strong point. It's a separate storyline from part 1, and shows a possible explanation for why Rorschach and Nite Owl Split. It touches upon some interesting themes such as the difference between what is legal and what is ethical, and has an interesting gameplay twist at the very end, so the plotline is decent. 

What isn't so good is the gameplay. In part 1, you could unlock new moves, which kept the gameplay from getting completely stale. In part 2, you start off with all of the moves from part 1 unlocked, which makes sense, but you don't unlock anything more. You end the game with the same skills you started with, meaning there is no progression and the difficulty curve is more of a difficulty flatline. Furthermore, part 2 is the same length as part one (about three hours), but has half as many levels (a total of 3), meaning you're stuck in the same area for twice as long and fighting the same enemies for twice as long (and just like part 1, there's really only two or three enemy types, just having different models on each level). The effect that all of this has is that every fight in the game is essentially identical, and since the game is almost nonstop fighting, you're going to have a bland time. Furthermore, the final level is just annoying, as it consists of you chasing the villain through a mansion. Everytime you catch up to said villain, she says something essentially boiling down to ""HAHA YOU'LL NEVER CATCH ME WATCHMEN"" and then runs off to another room. This repeats several times in a row and just felt like a lame way to keep you moving through the level.

Overall, can't reccomend this one, even though the story is decent.",False,93
21030,"Heard joke once: Man goes to doctor. Says he's depressed. Says life seems harsh and cruel. Says he feels all alone in a threatening world where what lies ahead is vague and uncertain.

21030,"One more chapter of street brawl beat'em up with Watchmen characters, '70s decorations and overall grim atmosphere of the end of western civilization. I ""recommend"" the game, yes. But just barely. And only for those who really love Watchmen series and Rorschach in particular, since it's one of the two games where you can control him to brake some bones in usual ""street justice"" quest.

Some say that ""The End is Nigh Part 2"" is much much better than ""Part 1"". It's a great exaggeration. Some little annoying things were tuned a bit, but generally ""Part 1"" and ""Part 2"" are quite the same. The second part was released only four months after the first part... The game engine is the same, the gameplay is the same and even the enemies are mostly the same. What's new? Well, it's a new chapter of Watchmen's story, a new quest, not correlated with the Watchmen movie or the first game. You still have a choice of Rorschach or Nigth Owl (or both in local co-op game) and they are almost the same as they were in Watchmen Part 1. Except for a little power up for Night Owl, to balance it in combat abilities with Rorschach (who was much more useful than Night Owl in the first game).
More to it, now you don't need to collect medallions to learn basic combat moves (rage cards and batteries are still there to find). Instead, now you have a proper tutorial, where you can learn how to block, evade, and make combo moves on your buddy. And after you finish the story, you'll have an additional option to fight a full-time battle between Rorschach and Night Owl. And maybe this versus battle is the best thing we have in the game, actually.
There are only three levels, each of them about an hour long. Just like the first game, there'll be some crossroads where two characters split for a while and taking some different routes. Rorschach still uses the lockpicks to get behind some locked doors with special cards to enhance his rage meter, and Night Owl still flies high with his grappling hook and looking for more electricity batteries. Just as before.

There is one new type of enemy: women. Cat-women, actually. They are agile and mean, but their faces just as fragile as any other opponents. I don't enjoy beating the women, so, my final mark will be even lower than for The End is Nigh Part 1.
5.7/10 mark. However, if you really like cracking the women's skulls, maybe it'll be one of your favorite games of all time.  
Watchmen: The End is Nigh was not a bad game 10 years ago. Now we have many more solid beat'em up titles, starting with Batman serial, so I suggest to try some newer games. Unless you really want Rorschach (or Night Owl) under your hand.",True,21
21030,"I played the second part and like the first it was short even shorter than the first part with only 3 chapters. Also if you read my review of the first part its pretty much the same with this one. So Beat em Up Fans if this game is in sale its worth it if not then let your hands of it. The combos are also the same as in the first part maybe some small changes you dont notice really much of it.

21090,"F.E.A.R. is a classic first-person shooter that still holds up today. As someone who played it back in the day, I can attest to its effectiveness in creating a tense and frightening atmosphere. The combination of eerie sound design, creepy visuals, and unpredictable encounters with Alma and the other supernatural enemies keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the game.

One of the standout features of F.E.A.R. is its advanced AI system. Enemies will intelligently flank you, take cover, and use grenades to flush you out. It's impressive how the game's AI can still provide a challenging experience even by today's standards.

The gunplay in F.E.A.R. is satisfying and smooth. Each weapon feels unique, and the game encourages experimentation to find your favorite loadout. The slow-motion mechanic adds a layer of strategy to the combat, allowing you to take out multiple enemies with precision shots.

The storyline in F.E.A.R. is engaging, with a mysterious and complex plot that slowly unfolds over the course of the game. The various plot twists and revelations keep you invested in the narrative until the very end.

Overall, F.E.A.R. is a fantastic game that successfully blends horror, action, and story elements to create an unforgettable experience. Its advanced AI, satisfying gunplay, and engaging plot make it a must-play for any fans of the genre.",True,5

21090,"For it's time, FEAR had a lot of great things and reminded me HL a bit :)
Nice balance between action, story and spooky elements.
AI still looks very cool with all things your enemies can do.
Visuals are also still nice, although of course a bit dated.
Default controls are a bit strange, so most of players will change them :D
So overall, it is a solid FPS game that still has some interesting things to show you, I liked it.

Regarding DLCs:

- Extraction point is kinda bad. Feels more like a mod for the most parts of it. Too much shooting and shooting with almost no story bits. It becomes interesting only at the end, like a level or two. Then DLC is over. Also, it has some serious performance problems, huge frame drops for no reason. I felt like I am a kid again and playing this on old PC. Because in some sequences I had 15-20 frames. Very nice during fights indeed :D

- Perseus Mandate is very good. It is on par with the main game. Tons of story bits and scripted scenes. Also performance is much better (just like in main game), I had only once some frame drops.

To sum up:
- FEAR is great, liked it.
- Extraction Point has almost no point to play for me, 80% of it is just action without real story bits.
- Perseus Mandate is a great addon.
- You can play FEAR and Perseus Mandate and just read/watch Extraction Point's story, saving some time :)",True,2

This game did absolutly nothing right and completly destroyed a franchise that had such a great start.",False,3
21100,"I am admittedly way late to the party on this one, but I felt I had to post nonetheless in order to (hopefully) save a few die-hard fans of the series from wasting their time and money on this heap of garbage.

Disclaimer: I knew full well within the first 30 minutes of the game, that I should have gone for my Steam refund on this one. But I wanted to finish out the series, and give it a full chance. It is somewhat satisfying having closure to the cliff-hanger that was FEAR 2, but I cannot with good conscience recommend this game to ANYONE. It is objectively bad in almost every aspect of its making, and it's a terrible shame that the fans were left with this, when so much more seemed to be in store.

FEAR 3 was set up by its predecessors extraordinarily well to be a truly epic ending to a series. But then it almost immediately demonstrated that it was going to be a complete and total LETDOWN. First things first: if you've played any of the previous FEAR games, throw out everything you know about the gameplay. FEAR is now a cover-based shooter, where even the dumbest and weakest of your enemies will kill you quickly on higher difficulties if you don't play by the new rules, covering often while you heal. FEAR 3 feels so disjointed at times from all of the cobbled-together aspects, that it's painfully obvious that this is no longer a FEAR game. It's a feeble attempt to mimic other ""successful"" games on the market (*cough*CoD*cough).

The guns all feel watered down with only one or two exceptions. I wasn't the biggest fan of the ASP Rifle in the first FEAR, but it was effective. In FEAR 3, its equivalent, the G3A3 Assault Rifle (which ironically by name SHOULD be the successor to the G2A2 Assault Rifle from the first game, but clearly ISN'T) is the ONLY gun that frankly didn't suck in some way. The shotgun was OP in OG FEAR, but in FEAR 3, it neither has the imposing sound nor the deleterious effect of turning your enemies into a red mist, so it's kind of useless except against certain enemies. Grenades just can't be thrown with any reliable accuracy; more often than not you'll end up with the grenade rolling off into some area NEAR your enemy, but just far enough away such that it won't KILL your enemy. And all the specialty weapons either don't exist, or are only handed to you so sparingly throughout the campaign that you don't really have all that much time to fall in love with anything they might have to offer.

Movement is also quite different. Now that FEAR is a cover shooter, say goodbye to all that frenetic, high-energy dancing all over the map with your enemies. Because this new cover mechanic is entirely BROKEN with the addition of your slow-motion abilities, I basically cheesed my way through nearly every single fight.

I will admit that the vehicle fights were at least entertaining, though not particularly challenging. It was indeed fun to engage in a slugfest with other mecha enemies from time to time. Without this addition to break up the monotony, I have no doubt that the new gameplay loop would have felt like an infinite slog towards... somewhere... maybe?

The story. Oh dear GOD, the story. What in the actual **** were the writers of this game thinking? LITERALLY mindless writing leaving you with a POINTLESS conclusion regardless of which ending you get. I'm Not buying the idea that ""Point Man"" from the first game is going to play ball with Fettel, and I'm not buying that Fettel cares or ""needs"" his brother's help to escape whatever facility the game starts in (he's a freaking GHOST). The loading screens and occasional cutscenes try to indicate that seeds of distrust have been sewn between the two brothers, and that they are somehow competing with each other for... IDK, their mother's approval (literally that at the end... BLEH). But Point Man's look says ""I just wanna kill all of you paranormal freaks"" and Fettel's actions throughout the game are there to do nothing other than provide the occasional moment of deus ex machina for you at seemingly impossible scenarios that need a paranormal touch to resolve. But I guess, when you're in a paranormal playhouse of sorts, you'll take whatever handouts you can get if they'll help you to survive. The story just sort of meanders around aimlessly, and you sort of just find yourself at the end going ""uh, what?"", or in my case ""WHY??!"".

Speaking of the paranormal... Alma. Good GOD what they did to Alma... Without giving any spoilers away, let's just say that she isn't a threat anymore, and therefore she isn't SCARY anymore. Now realistically any time you see her for the split second they put her in an area, you're likely going to still get that skin-crawl effect that has been burned into your very core from the trauma you experienced completing the first couple of games, but then you stop and say to yourself ""oh right... she's ""good(?) in this game"" and then immediately wonder why they put that creepy little tidbit in if it does nothing to serve the story and actually shouldn't be scary (not really anyway) in the context under which she's being presented (protective mother...maybe?).

So if Alma isn't the enemy here, who is? No spoilers, but let's just say you've seen him before, and until now there was ABSOLUTELY NO REASON TO BELIEVE HE HAD ANY PSYCHIC ABILITIES, but yet somehow he seems to be a very real threat to all three of the uh... anti-heroes in our story.

The ending. WHOOOOAAH buddy. That ending. Again, no spoilers here, but yeah... In FEAR 2 you were left with one HELL of a surprise CLIFFHANGER of an ending, one that I didn't see coming, and although it's a bit asinine if you think about it, was shocking enough to at least put your mind into that ""OH MY GOD"" state of despair and terror at the prospects of what was implied. FEAR 3, on the other hand, well... the short bus came in hot with its riveting story and absurd plot points. I suppose that a large portion of what happened here, is that in the other FEAR titles, you're playing as the opposing team (the ones trying to fight Alma and Fettel). Now that Point Man has apparently switched teams (or HAS he? GASP!), and everything is about ""family"" (UGH), I guess the veil has been peeled back a little bit, and you get to see that all of that terror and mayhem (of which there is still plenty, BTW) was really just being caused by a couple of dysfunctional kids who didn't like having psychic powers and so decided it was their entire purpose of existence to END everyone else's, and that most of the chaos was really just Alma being in a lot of physical pain--for a ghost.

The aftermath. I was left with a lot of questions. WHY does this game exist? WHO approved it, and HOW did they think that any of the writing was in any way passable when standing next to literally any other entry in the series? I could have forgiven the developers for selling out on its gameplay mechanics; for abandoning their aesthetics to mimic modern titles at the time; heck, even for the absolutely ATROCIOUS level design throughout most of the game (invisible walls and lazy flow ideas abound). But FEAR always had one thing going for it that set it apart from its competition: a COMPELLING story with incredibly EERY content that could make your skin crawl just from the ideas being spawned inside your mind. FEAR and FEAR 2 were thoughtful and original treatments to the horror genre, translated extremely well over to the interactive medium of video games. FEAR 3, however, decided to dump that formula, adopt generic horror tropes and mediocre jump-scares instead of truly HARROWING content and ideas we've come to expect; attempting to glue it all together with a poor copy-paste of the CoD FPS mechanics. And that's what we got. A mediocre FPS, a cheap set of thrills that only truly reaches the point of being ""scary"" once or twice over its entire stay, and a dumpster-fire ending for Alma and the brothers that held SO. MUCH. POTENTIAL. Poor treatment of excellent source material.",False,1

Somewhat similar in level to TF2's goofiness (actually it's a lot goofier), but the gameplay is very different.  First of all, there is no server list; every game is a ""pickup"" game where you're just thrown together with other available players.  Teams are assigned randomly at first, then automatically balanced for subsequent games based on player performance.

Respawn is instant and maps are small and complicated.  There are almost no ""camping spots"" as there are multiple paths to almost everywhere.  I find it is best to constantly stay in motion, seeking targets, but I'm still learning.

The only ""classes"" are the five body types, ranging from small and fast to big and tough.  Any body type can equip any two weapons and two gadgets.  Mixing and matching builds is part of the fun, and new stuff unlocks as you level up.

And of course there's the fun of designing your costumes!

Gravitron 2 is one of the 100 best video games ever made. It delightfully merges gameplay elements from Gravitar, Tempest and Choplifter! in one amazing package. I'm seeing people complain about the controls - these people are lazy and probably trying to use a mouse. It's got Asteroids-style controls, buttons for everything. So now it's Gravitar, Tempest, Choplifter! and Asteroids. 

There's more levels than anyone will probably ever play. It looks gorgeous. It has a wonderful learning curve, things blow up nicely when they blow up and it is THE best retro arcade-style game on Steam. There are some levels where you need to think a bit and some where you can just go hogwild. It also has shields and the ability to get more fuel from the environment, so now it's Gravitar, Tempest, Choplifter!, Asteroids, Asteroids Deluxe and Scramble.

Here's a few important starting tips if you decide to buy this game (which you should):

- The default level pack on the main menu is ""OfficialPack1."" [b]That is the expansion.[/b] Click once so that you are starting with the ""Standard"" pack, which are the levels from the initial release. Otherwise the game will seem very difficult to start with.

- Use your shield. It will deflect all standard bullets and is a lifesaver in tight areas. By default it is bound to the middle mouse button; I suggest rebinding it to a more reflex-friendly key like the spacebar, or use a controller. All controls can be rebound from the options menu, which is available after starting the game. You can also adjust the mouse sensitivity there.

- You can land on any flat surface, including walls and celings, and you will not take damage from landing at high speeds, as long as you are correctly aligned.


Gravitron 2 is a near-perfect game for me, with only one significant flaw: There are no online leaderboards. There were at one point, hosted on a third-party server, but that server is down for good. Steam leaderboards would be a major benefit, though there is little hope of that happening now.

Updated 6/3/15:  @my couch...   Yes, I was using the CD Key.  SecureRom does not accept the CD Key given to me by Steam.  I used both the ""Copy to Clipboard"" method as well as writing it down and keying it in manually to attempt to activate my game.  Neither method work.  I get the same Activation Failed issue.  The SERIAL was not found in the database.  Most likely the SERIAL has been entered incorrectly.

So, no Age of Booty to play.

21690,"⠀⠀⠀Имея за спиной более десяти пройденных резидентов, могу от себя заявить, что единственный отвратный и выбешивающий представитель серии, который не могу даже порекомендовать для ознакомления. Все мною пройденные хоть и были со своими раздражителями, но здесь раздражает буквально все: от топорного управления до навязанного кооператива с ужасно реализованным ботом-напарником. Единственный положительный момент, который я выделил для себя - это рассказ событий, которые остались вне игр серии, но имеют вес и значимость для лора.

⠀⠀⠀Начнем с управления. Оно мерзкое и будет с вами на протяжении всей игры. Со временем с ним свыкнетесь, но само его наличие будет подводить и раздражать во множестве игровых моментов. Хоть управление и базируется на наработках четвертой части, тогда он на удивление не отторгал. В пятой части топорность и неманевренность во время перемещения и стрельбы возведены в абсолют. Атмосфера в игре отсутствует напрочь, ибо элементарно нет музыкального сопровождения на фоне по ходу прохождения. Всё ограничивается саундом во время файтов. В первые пол часа есть атмосфера загадочности, но она резко улетучивается. Насчет головоломок. На моей памяти было что-то одно похожее на это, но ее решит даже детсадовец за 10 секунд. Внедрив кооператив в игру (который хоть и никогда не требовался франшизе), он мог бы поспособствовать в создании интересных моментов на включение мозга и взаимодействие двух игроков между собой, но и этот момент разрабы упустили по какой-то причине. 

⠀⠀⠀Кооператив. Самое сладкое. Из-за чего у меня зад полыхал на протяжении всех трех прохождений, в особенности на профессиональной сложности. Если вы будете играть с ботом-напарником – готовьте что-то от потенциального возгорания. Бот максимально тупой и неотзывчивый. Когда нужно совершить парное QTE, он шляется где-то и хрен пойми чем занимается. То лутается, то лезет на ражон и тратит хилки, моментами может вообще встрять в текстурах, что у меня было не раз, и приходилось перезапускать чекпоинт… Командовать им толком нельзя, команды “атака” и “прикрытие” отличается только дистанцией, на которой напарник держится от вас. В гуще перестрелок может лезть к вам под перекрестие, загораживая весь обзор. Менеджмент инвентаря ужасно костыльный, передавать и перемещать предметы сплошная боль. Что вообще можно говорить, если элементарно нельзя задать оружие, которое будет держать ваш напарник. Просто слов нет как ущербно бот реализован…

⠀⠀⠀Если кратно об игре, то это коридорный тир между катсценами без сопровождающего ОСТ, без сюжетных интриг и без грамотного управления. Платные ДЛС, которые длиной  на 30 минут каждый, играются куда интереснее оригинальной истории. Особенно Lost in Nightmares. Вайб первых резидентов прекрасен. По ощущениям разрабы пытались сфокусироваться на кооперативной составляющей, но этот момент по итогу не доработали и вдобавок ко всему заруинили всё остальное. Вы ничего не потеряете, если пройдете мимо этого игры. Интересные детали лора серии можно прочитать в интернете, а сам сюжет пятой части по сути никак не влияет на серию целиком, а просто закрывает рамки событий для пары-тройки персонажей.

In CSI however: this tends to be more slow paced, find where you can click, look on the internet in case you missed something that stops you progressing the case, pronounce ""OH!"" and carry on.

21760,"From the developer of Ground Control and Ground Control 2, I really shouldn't have to say anything more than that.

Though now defunct, this real time strategy features one of the most unique multiplayer systems. Each player on a team assumes controle of a different branch: Infantry, Armor, Air, or Support. This makes for a more cooperational multiplayer experience that you can't get in any other real time strategy, perfect for a LAN party. Much like the Ground Control series, this game has no base building and relies entirely on dropping units into supply zones and maximizing their utility.

The single player campagin is very scripted allowing for spectacular showcases of destruction. I play through it every few years. The graphical fidelity of this game crushed computers upon release and they still hold up to this day.

21760,"I have played World in Conflict for about 6 years now and I strongly recommend it. It is one of the best games I have ever played. The graphics are still fantastic years later. The mechanics have a property of ""emergent difficulty""--they are simple at first, allowing the player to be engaged, but over time the complexity of the game reveals itself and even now, 6 years later, I am learning new tactics and ways to play. After playing WiC, other strategy games are simply not as satisfying.

Common questions answered:

Why does the game crash after loading?

This issue arises on Windows 7. The developers never resolved it as support was mostly cut after Massive was acquired by Ubisoft, but the crash is easily fixable. Go to your ""My Documents"" folder in Windows and find the ""World in Conflict"" folder. Then, scroll to the ""Game Options"" text file. Be careful not to edit anything unintentionally. Scroll to the ""MyDX10Flag"" and change the number next to it to zero. The game should run without problems. Visit massgate.net and post in General Discussion if you still have issues, we will try to help.

Is the game still active online?

There are always 2 servers full with a variety of maps in their rotation. There are many experienced players around, especially on the forums, who can help you learn the game mechanics and ideal tactics. The activity level started falling in 2009 but has remained steady at about 2000-3000 players active since 2012. This is not a lot, but it is plenty to be able to enjoy all that WiC has to offer for new players. Visit the forums at massgate.net to talk to experienced players.

Is the campaign good?

The campaign has an intriguing story but it is not as tactically engaging as the multiplayer portion. I recommend playing the campaign to familiarize yourself with the game functions and then to dive into the multiplayer. Many players are agressive to new players, but these people are often bad, so you should simply ignore them and try your best.

Any tips for gameplay?

1. Don't move your units in a blob. Try to separate them.
2. As a beginner, don't use artillery units. If you do use them, use only one. Your team will appreciate it.
3. Don't be discouraged! As you play more, you will get a lot better and soon you'll be laughing at the noobs who play like you used to.
4. Use the chat and the ""Q"" button commands to communicate with the other players on your team.

I hope you will try out WiC. If you don't want to pay, you can easily pirate the game on piratebay.se or your favorite torrent site, but you'll need a game key to play online. Message me or go online to massgate.net/forums.php if you have any questions.

21760,BEST RTS of all time!,True,141
21760,"Here is my Review of World in Conflict

I remember picking up this game when it first came out like 4-5 years ago, I really wanted this game because this was the first modern military RTS I saw and it was actually very graphically pleasing so I knew I had to pick it up. Im glad I did, I loved this game, it was the only game I played for a number of months when I originally bought it. But I bought it again it over the Black Friday sale, I got the original game ""World in Conflict"" and the second installment ""Soviet Assault"" (Which I haven't played yet as I am writing this, but I will!). It was really one of a kind when it came out because Wargame didn't release yet and neither did Endwar so it really was a new step in RTS gaming in my opinion.

The game is set in 1989 during the fall of the Soviet Union. The game starts off with the Russians Invading American from the northwest coast and overwhelming the national guard forces and you have to push them back off the mainland, you also play in Europe and Russia which prequel the Soviet Invasion on America. You play as Captain/First Lieutenant Parker, it's one of those games where your face is never shown and you don't talk. You can command US and Nato forces in the Campaign but you can also play the Russians in Multiplayer (You can play as the Russians in Campaign with the ""Soviet Assault"" add on) The campagin is excellent and scripted very well.

I would say this game is a cross between Endwar, Joint Task Force and Wargame, I would say it's more like Joint Task Force and Endwar even though individual soldiers and vehicles are stock threw out the game and you cannot be upgraded but how the camera works its similar to the Endwar mechanic as well as telling units where to go, but it is actual military vehicles like JTF and Wargame but the maps are not as massive and the game is definitely less chaotic. The game is quite story based it's not really open world do whatever you want, you are kinda told what to do but the way you do an objective can vary. The Multiplayer at least in my experience is quite sparse, there is usually only 1 lobby with people and that's about it, but each lobby can have up to 16 people.

My final verdict is this game is excellent, it is definitely one of the best Military RTS's on the market if not the best, you should definitely pick this game up again if you like Wargame, Joint Task Force and Endwar.
Cheers \m/

P.S. I recommend trying this mod out, it makes all the vehicles modern, it improves the graphics and a lot more, but it does still have a few things that can be fixed but I have hope that the mod will get better. http://www.moddb.com/mods/wicmw",True,92

21760,"World in Conflict is a real-time strategy game from Massive Entertainment, the maker of Ground Control series, and now is owned by Ubisoft. World in Conflict set in the nearly end of the cold war between the west and the east, where the Soviet Union launch a major invasion of Europe instead of collapsing. They even finally reached North America by invading through the city of Seattle with some tricks. The World War III has begun.

World in Conflict features a real-time tactic style gameplay where you drop your units straight into the fight without requiring building a base. You set your drop zones, then select units you want to deploy and send them right into the battlefield via airdrop. Each unit has offensive and defensive abilities that vary depending on the units. The faction that are available in this game are USA, Soviet Union and NATO. World in Conflict also features tactical aid system where you call in an artillery support, precision strike, reinforcement drop, air support, anti-air support or even WMD such as the tactical nuke.

The multiplayer part of the game require you to play one of four available roles in the game, the infantry role, armored division role, aviation role or the support role. This makes team works very important to win a multiplayer game.

World in Conflict has amazing graphics and good destructible environment. The ground will change shape as the battle rages. Units has very detailed models and textures with good animation. The game also runs pretty smooth and optimized.

World in Conflict is good game to play, I recommend this.

21900,"[h1]Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X[/h1]

Arcade-style aerial-combat game. The game has plenty to offer for single player, but it doesn't offer much in the way of competitive multiplayer content.

From a distance and up high in the altitude, the environments--which are created with real satellite data--look beautiful. Natural landscapes and expanses of water are incredibly lifelike, and city skylines are nicely detailed. But if you fly too low, the illusion is shattered. The planes are the game's stars, and each one is modeled realistically with great attention to detail. Light bounces off of wings, afterburners glow with blistering heat, missiles launch in clouds of smoke, and explosions serve as a gorgeous reminder of just how much power you have at your command. 

I gotta warn that the keyboard and Mouse controls have a steep learning curve. Since this is pretty much an arcade-ish title, you should give it a shot with a controller instead.


[h1]POSITIVES:[/h1]
[b]+Visually, the game looks nice, mostly.
+Realistic planes and environments (from distance and high altitude only).
+Great, action-packed dogfighting
+Good gameplay.
+Experience point, challenge system, stats, and unlocks help out keeping things interesting.[/b]

[h1]NEGATIVES:[/h1]
[b]-DirectX 10 very unstable on Modern Windows OS (Running in Windows Vista Compatibility Mode solved my crashes).
-Poor porting from consoles.
-Low replayability value (especially if you played and finished the game on Hardest setting).
-Poor voice acting.
-Uninspired mission design.
-Typos on the subtitles.
-Limited multiplayer modes.
-Ground textures look ugly up close.
-Planes handle mostly all similarly.
-Planes are flying VERY slowly (something you wouldn't expect especially for a arcade-ish game).
-Friendly AI is weak (you're better of handling every battles yourself!).[/b]


[h1]OVERALL:[/h1]
Tom Clancy’s HAWX is very close to being a great game; it’s just missing a few of the intricate pieces that create an enthralling experience. As it is the mission design is lacking, the combat is unimaginative, and the multiplayer is shallow. 


[h1]RECOMMENDATION:[/h1]
[b]With all the many negatives listed above, I still recommend this game since the game is pretty cheap nowadays. If you love arcade-sim combat games, sure give HAWX a try! But I did played better games before and you may look at other alternatives to suite your aerial-combat needs![/b]",True,33
21900,"It may not live up to Ace Combat, but its defenitly better than Assault Horizon.",True,31
21900,"To my expectation-- and delight-- the gameplay was very similar to Ace Combat games that predate Assault Horizon.

Zip around in fighter planes armed with 60+ missiles, maneuver to shoot down other planes, bomb targets on land & sea, avoid missiles, and protect assets in escort/protection missions.



I personally didn't care for the Enhanced Reality System or [Assistance-]OFF MODE, and did not use them outside of the two missions that absolutely required the player to use them.

The game seemed to favor the 3rd person camera. It was the default view. I prefer dashboard/cockpit views in my air combat games, and OFF MODE forces the camera to a 3rd person perspecitve. Kind of an immersion-breaker there.

Disappointingly, this means it is impossible to perform a manual stall as a tactical maneuver in the first person view.



A rather major complaint I have with the cockpit view is that it is missing the pitch/roll and bearing indicators on the dashboard HUD. Instead, it is completely blank! This requires the player to actually use the artificial horizon and compass on the instrument panel.

While this may seem like a good idea for immersion, they are hard to quickly read at a glance and are different on every plane. That's appropriate for an in-depth flight combat simulator, not a more arcade-style flight combat game like HAWX. Even then, the HUD on the dashboard would display that information for a pilot.

Additionally, airspeed and altitude are displayed on-screen anyway, so it's not as though they left out the pitch/roll and bearing indicators for immersion. So this seems more like a mistake than an intentional game mechanic. This was not fixed in HAWX2, from what I've seen in screenshots. 

Thankfully, the game has a ""flying camera"" perspective similar to Ace Combat's default view, which displays pitch, roll and bearing in addition to airspeed and altitude.



The plane variety was more than adequate. Overachieving, even. For instance: The SR-71 'Blackbird' is available, but no missions require its specialization; Strategic Reconnaissance. Though I suppose it has no place in any flight combat game, what with being an unarmed spyplane that was effectively replaced by satellites.



The story was rather lackluster. No character development of the wingmen, no fantastic superweapons to conquer, and the final mission didn't feel like a final mission at all. Maybe this is just Tom Clancy's flavor of ""real fiction"", or maybe Ace Combat's strangereal world events set my expectations too high.



Overall: TOTALLY DECENT, and the best Ace Combat clone I've played thus far. However, I found it rather difficult to not constantly compare HAWX to Ace Combat. In fact, I dare say that my single favorite thing about HAWX is that it made me decide to whip out my PlayStation 2 and replay its Ace Combat games.",True,15

21910,"Alright, this is not only a review but a slight Tutorial in helping thos who are having an issue running this game, (crash issue where is goes black as soon as you hit the main menu).

First the review
This game is amazing, if you love RTS, this game is for you. If you love Cold War Era themed games, this is for you. If you love Military warfare games, this is for you.
you get tactical points for capturing strategic points to win tug of war style domination play, as well as when your units are damaged/killed or when you kill/damage enemy units, you gain more of these tactical points through killing enemy units rather than losing your units. you can also share these tactical points with your allies in online play.
now, onto what these points are for. You use them for a number of things ranging from artillery strikes, to laser guided bombs, to Tactical Nuclear Strike, yes you heard right! YOU GET TO USE A FUD RUKKIN' NUCLEAR WARHEAD, and it ain't no crappy warhead that hardly affects an area of the map, it affects a LARGE portion of the map, to use a nuke costs A LOT of tactical points and it doesn't warant a win, if you don't dropp it on the enemy in a way to decimate their force utterly, you just wasted almost all of your tact. points on NOTHING so use it wisely. it also creates a ground zero zone like a real nuke. infantry will die if they are not transported by anything through the zone.
next thing, you do NOT build a base, you call in reinforcements through a set amount of reinforcement points you start with and slowly gain overtime, you cannot spam an OP unit so to speak, you are regulated as you have a limited amount depending on the match setup, you can have anywhere from 4000 to (i believe) 8000 reinforcment points, you best unit for your role costs around 1200 points, and a unti outside of your role could cost EVEN more, so be wise in what you spend your reinforcement points on, also you are refunded a units reinforcement cost if they are to die in combat, but slowly over time, not instantly, this bring a nice balance to the game.
finally, the roles. There are 4 roles, Infantry, Armor, Support, and Aircraft. Infantry uses jeeps, transport trucks and obiously infantry, it is a key role for defending positions from aircraft and tanks in order to keep ahead of the enemy for victory. Next, Armor, this role is for taking and occasionally holding positions from the enemy, you use APC (Armored Personnel Carriers) Amphibious APC's Light, Medium, and Heavy tanks. Heavy tanks are your main Tank Destroyer, as their offensive ability allows them to quickly destroy Med. and light tanks, their standard attack is also formidable. Mediums, believe it or not, are your main Anti-infantry vehicle aside from APC's, as their offensive abily is a white Phosphorous round (it burns the infantry like a flamethrower, but from a greater range) and the standard attack of the medium is quite average, enough of these tanks can destroy heavy tanks if the enemy heavies are not careful. and finally their is the Light tank, this little buggar is your backbone, you cannot have enough of these. their offensive is an ATGM rocket so that it can have a chance at destroying its Heavy adversairies, its basic attack is good against infanty and enough of these buggars can kill mediums and even heavies, if you are good. almost all vehicle defensive abilities are a smoke screen, so they can conceal themselves for a retreat, repair, and attack again. btw the repair vehicle is the jeep, and recovery tank, support is the only one who can buy the recovery tank, anyone of any role can buy a jeep. APC's double as anti infantry and anti aircraft, you can also use APC's of yours to transport allied infantry in multiplayer THATS FRIGGIN AWESOME!!!
next we have support, this is your artillery, dedicated Anti-aircraft (SAM launchers and quadruple A's), and your repairman for vehicles, although repair for the support player is more of a side job.
artiller does what artiller does, shells dug in targets to weken them for an offensive, their abilities also consist of a smoke round for blinding the enemy or concealing your allies, and i believe they can send White Phosphorous artillery rounds to burn infantry out of houses and forests.
anti-aircraft, you got Heavy and Medium, light does not exist. Heavy AA is your missle launchers like SAM's, which work so long as the enemy aircraft flare ability is down, this AA beats medium in range, but isn't 100% reliable on unit damage. Medium AA is your ballistic AA, meaning, it shoots bullets, this AA's offensive ability is quite useful, it changes it for a short period of time, into an anti light vehicle and anti anfantry vehicle, it basically aims its guns at ground targets, which is nice if they snuck infantry in close enough to your support vehicles.
finally their is aircraft, aircraft is for destroying pesky units that are a bother, aircraft cannot capture points for a win, but are invaluble in breaking the line. all aircraft used by this role, are helicopters.
you have Scout, Heavy, Medium, and Transport. Scout has not offensive, but has a VERY large sight  range, the largest in game in fact, and its ""offensive"" ability is infrared radar, it instantly detects infantry in forrests and buildings, very usful considering infantry is the stealthiest in the game and can get the jump on you if you are not careful. next is Heavy, this is your attack copter, it sucks at fighting in Air to Air combat, but will shred even Heavy Tanks in seconds, especially with its AT missile, offensive ability. next is Medium air, this is your copter hunter, it is absolutely horrible at fighting ground targets unless the targets are infantry without cover (FYI everything shredds infantry when they are not in cover) the offensive ability of Medium copters is an Air to Air missile attack, with a pretty quick cooldown, meaing, if you follow an enemy long enough after they used their flares, you'll kill em. next is the transport copter, use this if you want to help your infantry allies become a little more mobile on the battlefield, but be careful anything with a machine gun and AA missiles will shred a transport copter quickly.
if you don't get it by this time then i will say it now I RECOMMEND THIS GAME, BUY IT, LOVE IT, AND MAYBE DO THE NASTY TO IT, ok you can leave the last bit out. but this game is a hidden Gem, for an RTS it has a very strong emphasis on tactical prowess, you don't win through micro, you win by outplaying your enemy with superior tactics which is an AAAAAA++++++ in my book for an RTS.

now, time for the tutorial so you can play this game, it is quick easy and simple.
once installed, you find the World in Conflict folder in your documents on your computer, if it isn't directly in documents, it might be found in your steam folder.

21910,"A multiplayer focused RTS at heart, World in Conflict is a very challenging game for newcomers. Base building is replaced by managing reinforcement points to optimize the composition of your force, consisting of units from one of the four main doctrines: armor, air, infantry, or support. Although it is possible to deploy units from a different doctrine, it's far more expensive to bring to the battlefield. From personal experience, it feels as though some units are not very well balanced, such as Anti-Armor Infantry not feeling like an effective choice compared to the more versatile and cheaper Infantry unit. However, the off-map call-ins, called Tactical Assists or TA, are really in-depth and provide great dynamics to gameplay. However, bad players will have difficulty in spending points to use TA's, as the points are accumulated from performing well on the battlefield. Fortunately, you can trade these points to your teammates for them to use.

The singleplayer campaign is largely forgettable, with only a handful of touching moments, most notably at the climatic battle to protect the still-fictitious Strategic Defense Initiative, also known as the Star Wars project, from Soviet forces learning that the U.S. had nothing to protect itself against nuclear attack. The story does not go out of its way to fistpump ""AMERICA!"" like some other military games do, even going so far as having a central character being directly involved in what would be considered a war crime. However, the depiction of Soviet forces from their perspective is incredibly cliched and felt entirely uninspired (""[The Americans] shall know the greatness of Socialism!"" ... or something to that extent).

Overall, World in Conflict has easy to learn mechanics but difficult to master gameplay (in the multiplayer field, at least). Anyone with an itch for commanding American, Soviet, or NATO forces in an alternate history Cold War setting should give the demo a shot.",True,21

World in Conflict is a WW3 RTS game developed by Swiss game company Massive Entertainment and British company SwordFish, and Published by Ubisoft.

WIC SA follows the story of the dreaded WW3 coming to bear. the USSR has launched a surprise attack on West Berlin and are quickly spreading into Europe. throughout the campaign you play as both the USSR and the USA. the campaign happens all around the world, during the game you will fight in Italy,France,Germany,The United States,Norway,and Russia.

World In Conflicts campaign is surprisingly good. we get a cast of characters on both sides, but the people who really matter is Lieutenant Parker (The US you),Captain Bannon (The whinny guy who ends up sacrificing himself and thereby redeeming himself), and Colonel Sawyer the dude who gives all the orders. On the Russian side we have Lieutenant Romanov (Russian you), Nikolai Malashenko (crazy and insane Russian dude who wants to kill everyone), and Colonel Vladimir Orlovsky,the guy who gives all the Russians their orders

The whole deal is that the mighty USSR is falling apart. their only hope at keeping their nation together is seizing much needed resources. Resources owned by the west. with no other choice they attack the US and her allies. this is the part of WIC SA i really love. the Russians are not ""evil"" or even crazy (well, other than Nikolai) at the same time they do a great job of showing the ridicules amount of propaganda that people living in the USSR were exposed to. In fact WIC SA does a great job of not showing ether side as the ""Hero"" or the ""Villain"" both sides have their faults and both don't really want to be fighting.


Gameplay wise WIC SA is fun, and easy. it is not a extreme strategy game and is instead more focused on quick combat. one things thats a little annoying is the fact that Nukes and other WMDs are well.... pointless. they really don't do much damage and the ""craters"" they leave behind are pretty pitiful. Players chose a role before the battle, Armor,Support,Infantry, or Air. while you still can put other roles units on the battlefield they will cost more and some of the elites of that role are unavailable. WIC SA doesn't look the greatest, but seeing as it came out in 2009 its understandable.

In the end if you like quick action RTS (without base-building) then WIC SA is the game for you.",True,16

21970,R.U.S.E 2 pleasee!,True,135
21970,"R.U.S.E. is a strategy game that is based off of world war 2. There are a HUGE amount of things that are just awesome about this game.

Imagine that you are a general, leading the American army, and you find out you are up against the germans. You build your base and eventually start building some units. You use some RUSES (which are kinda like special tactics, only every faction has these) and find the enemy base. Then suddenly, a group of panzer IV's goes on a rampage in your base, but you survive. You start building anti-tank units and recon units to see where they are coming from. You see that they are using tanks along with air support. You see that there is a flaw with this, as they don't have any long range support, so you build some artillery (suprisingly, they work kinda like wargame. Long range, but only effective against large groups of units and buildings.) You start sending volley after volley against the enemy base, so he is forced to counter this. Meanwhile, you start building your own tanks and infantry, and while he is busy tracking down your artillery and trying to counter it, you attack. His Panzars, weakened by the barrage, fall easily to your Sherman medium tanks and you destroy his base, winning the match.

The units are actually accurate to history, meaning they have their own strengths and weaknesses that are reasonable. For ex: tanks are excellent against infantry and other tanks, but are no match to fighter-bombers. Another example are the bombers. They are slow and can't defend themselves from fighters, so you have to escort them with fighters.

I haven't really tried the multiplayer out yet, but it seems pretty good.

The graphics are awesome in this game. You can see the explosions up close, with all of the dirt and debris flying all over the place. The units are also detailed, you can see the damage as units like tanks and other vehicles look more and more beaten up as they get shot at. The is awesome to look at, especially up close. The camera actually shakes from the impact of tank shells and heavy artillery and the explosions are just beautiful to look at, even at low graphics.

The damage is also effective. Certain units have more firepower than others, making them really effective at what they do, especially the units that you can get later in the game. Like the Germans King Tiger and the Americans Pershing heavy tank. One of these things could hold off against at least 4 medium tanks before they succumb.

There are also experimental units that are in this. The super pershing for the Americans is one of the most powerful tank in the American arsenal, but you need to get a experimental factory in order to make one. Experimental units can range from super-heavy artillery to anti-air guns that can wipe the sky clean of even the biggest squadrons of bombers single handedly. 

Overall, this game has a very good impression. You can have firefights that can last from 5 seconds to 20 minutes if you aren't careful. The graphics are amazing to look at. The overall strategy required for this game is tremendous, as every unit has a purpous and even one unit can ruin your chances of winning the game. 

I rate this game a 9.5/10.

P.S. There are a few things that make this different from Wargame. Like the fact that you don't have a limit to how many units you have or can have.",True,94
21970,"If you are a fan of RTS (real time strategy) games  the R.U.S.E. is a must have.

R.U.S.E. is a simplified version of the famous Wargame Series.

[b]Pros[/b]

-No limit cap

-8 players max

-All nations (excluding DLC nation) are equally powerful in personal proffesion (Italy is great for spamming and rushhing, United States is equally balanced all around, Germany contains extremely powerful units but they are very pricey ect)
In other words all nations balance each other out.

-Free Nuclear War DlC (gives nuclear gamemode that contains nuclear units)

-High replayable action

-Same creators of the Wargame series

[b]Cons[/b]

-Not as many units like Wargame, but does contain decent amount of units, its not like 3 units per bulding

{Updated Added Con}
-Multiplayer lacks many online players. Rank matches are dead. Public player matches contain mostly players who been playing the game for hours (in other words too many elite players, rookies don't stand a chance.) 

-Japanese Nation available for $9.99 is out of balance and contains a very over powered units that can and does leave fellow players without much of a fair fight. 

-DLCs are over priced...

-No R.U.S.E. 2... not much of a GAME con but still why :(

-Level Cap 100

Intense campaign, Seat grasping battles,  well speculated gameplay, and easy to manage micro units

21970,"This game had great potential..Played the beta and loved it so much, I actually bought it for full price when it came out.  Multiplayer is still awesome but single player is lacking quiet a bit. There is nothing like chasing down some German artillery (that has been pounding your base) only to be stopped by an invisible barrier... A barrier that the computer has no problem moving and SHOOTING through  but you can do neither. Single player skirmishes matches are better, but most of the Ruses aren't that critical to use.

Graphics are not cutting edge but enjoyable. You can zoom in and watch the individual combats or zoom out to see the full map. Lots of flexibility in how you win matches. A full airbase only victory is even possible.

If you're also deep on the strategy part, Wargame is an even more in-depth experience, albeit a much more hardcore game. ([url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/chad83/recommended/251060]my review[/url])

The best things about the game are:
[list]
[*] Fantastic 3D, set up a barrage of artillery, zoom-in on the enemy units and enjoy.
[*] True to WWII units, with names and a nice history in the encyclopedia section which is a must-check.
[*] The ruse system makes for some really nice tricks you could pull off.
[*] Balanced nations.
[*] The scouting units and the hiding ones make for some seriously hard decisions and nice tactics. You'll always have to keep an eye out for traps and keep your scouts protected.
[*] Unit specifications are a very welcome tactic, you'll have to learn your units weaknesses or you'll get wiped out for misusing them.
[*] Decent AI, not the best but makes for some fun game-play.
[*] The ability to control the AI behavior in battle-mode is really nice, you could specify if the AI should be attacking at every opportunity, amassing units and then attacking late but in huge waves or have them concentrate on top-of-the-line research creating the best units possible.
[*] While it might seem minor, the feeling of operating on a map is very interesting in my opinion, the edge of the map is a model and the units with the tiles under them and the arrows lining your commands are really something to enjoy.
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
[*] The game urgently needs to allow the player to manually rotate a grouping of troops to face in the desired direction without having to move them. Some unites also retreat way too far when attacked and never go back to position making other units vulnerable unless you remember to re-position every grouping frequently.
[*] The research sections, though excellent in principle are a bit too limited. If you want to play straight-to-the point you'd be able to finish the whole game with just 2 or 3 researches made and it would be enough.
[*] Too few units, and too few options with them. While the forests and city traps are really cool, too few units can do that and too few other units are really specialized. I would have liked to have the option to send fighters to cover for a bomber run.
[*] Air units are almost impossible to fully operate. They are treated by type, selecting a group and labeling them does not guarantee they will be at the same airfield and therefore can't guarantee that they will hit at the same time.
[*] The campaign mode, while it has a nice story, is sometimes just plain stupid and lacking details or flooding you with dull moments. Either way you might find yourself either stuck or just fed up.
[*] Field defense structures are way too weak, most of these buildings were made to be the first line of defense but R.U.S.E. obviously wants to push the player towards a more unit-based play style where field defenses are only, hardly ever useful in the beginning of a game.

21980,"A sequel done right. Compared with the first game's rougher, jankier design, this game offers far better controls, gameplay, level design, and overall presentation. By far the most engaging aspect of the game is the story, which fills in several gaps left by the first game's ending. Even though you don't need to play the first game to enjoy Bound in Blood, there are several character beats and emotional scenes that make a stronger impact when viewed with the context provided by that first game. The yet-to-be-ordained, but sheer bad ass Ray (the Reverend from the previous game) and his younger, more subdued but still tough as nails brother Thomas (who appeared in the first game but only briefly at the beginning) are on an epic journey to discover the Gold of Juarez and reclaim their family's home lost in the aftermath of the American Civil War. Their pastor-to-be younger brother William is also joining them in an attempt to collect and contain the chaos that his brothers have wrought along the way. As circumstances unfold, an unexpected twist throws a wrench in the brothers' plans, forcing them to commit unimaginable acts in the names of greed and love. Their fates, would forever be Bound in Blood. 

Characters from the first game that had barely had time to develop or make an impression were fascinating to see become fully fleshed out characters. I also liked how the dynamic between the brothers and how their relationship was tested added a lot of emotional weight to the story that was not there in the first game (until the end). It also features several sections that mimic the design of the first game. Similar to it, the story has two protagonists. As an alternative to switching between characters throughout the different chapters, you can select which character you want to play as at the beginning for varying bits of dialog and gameplay. The game has open world areas in which you can ride a horse and free roam, as well as side quests you can pick up that are located in the nearby open world area to complete which provide money for upgrades and ammunition. On top of that there are upgraded variants of the numerous revolvers, rifles and shotguns you'll use. These variants give incentive to collect more money though it's frequently dropped from slain enemies.

All of the changes the sequel makes (and more such as improved Concentration mode) really help to improve the player experience this time around compared to the first game's dated, hacked together design. The game looks great in certain set pieces too really showing off the impressive visuals with improved lighting and vastly superior character models compared to those from the first game show how great games from the 7th generation of games could look. Also a noticeable improvement is the soundtrack which is much better here. At times it feels intense with this new heavy rock and western combat theme that makes you feel like the Doom Slayer wearing a cowboy hat and some returning themes as well that make the soundtrack a much more enjoyable aspect in comparison to the original. 

There are some drawbacks though with some low res textures, pop ins, draw distance not working properly, and one quirky bug when I would kill enemies with a shotgun but that one was fun. There were other odd issues that would crop up from time (texture jitters and shadows not working quite right during cutscenes) to time though most likely they can be attributed to playing on hardware the game wasn't originally created for. The game never crashed or had any other issues that majorly impacted gameplay though which was nice. I was mostly impressed with the game on a technical level. It was a much more polished experience this time around and nails its immersion factor more effectively than the first title.

I ended up really enjoying my time with Bound in Blood and was really happy to have played the first game to have a more well rounded understanding of the story here which tries so much harder than the prior release and succeeds. I joked in my previous review the first game was the RDR game you had at home when asking your mom to buy RDR. Surprisingly Bound in Blood feels more in tune with a RDR experience with the open world horseback riding, deep and complex characters with motivations and conflicting morals, and a respect to the historical time period with which the world and setting are crafted in with accurate weaponry, events, and places all woven into a memorable good time that builds upon the positive aspects of the first game successfully. It's a fun, original, and entertaining experience that you should experience. Can't wait to see how good Gunslinger (third game) is after the first two awesome games.

Highly recommended, especially if on sale.

Japan needs someone else to defend them because they have no AA besides a bunker and a mobile that's meh, ok AT, and their infantry is meant to strengthen some else's defenses not gaurd on their own. Their artillery/assault guns are not to great in that they have low damage and armor. Their tanks do good amounts of damage but they are squishy and best suited for bolstering a team mates assault force. One of few things about Japan that isnt supportive is their bombers which are amazing. So in summary, Japan isnt a bad country its only real downsideis that it relies on a supportive/defensive playstyle which (unfortunatley) is not seen much in R.U.S.E.

Role playing is solid- the type of character you choose to build often affecting the path through many quests even if those paths are a little more limited than we've come to expect, or result only in making certain things easier. There are genuine reasons to build one kind of character or another, rather than the same generalist every time, and the limited level cap forces you to specialise. Overall, coming back to the game after a very long time has been a fun time exploring, even if it's not quite the experience 1,2 and NV are.

The side quests are quite fun as well and provide a good change of pace from the wastes of the Wasteland, which the DLCs do well too, as for the main questline it is nice but kind of disappointed that there wasn't a big baddie like in Fallout 1 and 2, but the more cinematic approach to the main campaign does make up for it in a way.

22320,"I remember my younger sibling picked this up when it was new. We had a blast just goofing off, although I don't remember actually playing it seriously at all. It's high time I tried, and well, I can't say I regret it.
Keep in mind, I circled back to this game after having played through Skyrim. The game shows its age (which one? Yes. The answer is Yes.) but I find that at its heart, it's not bad. Just come ready to read and take a BOATLOAD OF NOTES and you'll be fine.

Well, let's kick this off with the pros:
+ More control over your character build, compared to Skyrim. You have stats instead of Health/Magicka/Stamina. It feels more in-tune with what I expect and enjoy in TTRPGs.
+ You level up by doing things. Practice makes perfect, as the old saying goes. It's a neat notion. Level up 10 skills to gain a character level and assign stats, and the key stats for those skills will get bonuses if you assign points to them on leveling up.
+ The scenery is cool. I mean, it's a little bit like ""Fantasy Florida/Louisiana"" in spots, but the somewhat unusual sensibilities in the architecture and the giant mushrooms get a smile out of me.
+ The soundtrack. ""The Road Most Travelled"" is a classic track for a reason.

Alrighty, now the cons:
- Unfortunately, you have to level up by doing things. Killing monsters and fighting your enemies will ultimately only net you XP for the weapons you use, the spells you cast, the armour you wear when you take hits, and if you use a shield then maybe you'll get XP for blocking, if you succeed in blocking any blows.
- Leveling up your skills is somewhat slow, particularly to start.
- Good gravy, that's a LOT of reading.
- Like holy cow, SO MUCH READING.
- Some of the age shows. Things are a bit clunky, key mapping is a bit bothersome, and of course the right mouse button isn't bound to any secondary functions. It opens your inventory. There's no compass/objective radar on your HUD, which makes navigation a bit tricky.
- Ew, weapon and armour durability. Wish I had more insight, but unfortunately while this was a nifty idea on paper -- particularly back in 2002 -- it mostly just makes the idea of running around starkers and unarmed a lot more appealing.

22370,"I have mixed feelings for this game after replaying it after so many years. On one hand i have the nostalgia of me playing this around 2009/2010 and having a blast with the game and on the other hand i have my hatred of this game for playing it in 2023 because of the crashes, bugs, crashes and even more crashes.

At it's core the game is an improvement compared to the older fallout games, this being the first 3D game in the series. With this change came a lot of things that got better:
-gone are the walls of texts from when talking with a character and welcomed is the voice acting (not that i mind it but i do enjoy some voice acting)
-gone is the bad inventory system that is replaced with an easy to navigate inventory
-gone is the bad UI that is replaced with a clean and useful UI

The improvements didn't stop here, we did get a better main story plot line and better side content as side quests or locations to visit that can tell a story of what happened there even without the help of a quest in that region.
The majority of the items are common items that you can encounter on people from the wasteland or in the inventory of merchants, but some are unique items and i loved hunting them down. Some were in unique locations where the previous holder met a gruesome ending while some of the unique items are rewards or you find them on the enemies you kill.

I loved the karma system and wish more games implemented the morality system this way and not just the annoying and boring 'X will remember that'.

The main quest line was fun, but a bit cliche to be fair. I did enjoy going through it.
The side content was more interesting for me compared to the main quest line. There were so many small side quests that impressed me way more that any of the quests in the main plot line.

The companions are brain dead. Their AI was written by interns and you can't convince me otherwise. The companions always stop in corridors and won't let you pass, yell random voice lines during fights, get in front of you shooting at an enemy and eat your bullets. I played solo most of the game and only got a companion (Fawkes) while doing the last quests from the main plot line.

The dlcs were a let down, yep all of them disappointed me with how shallow they were. It was a balance from what i saw, some either had a new map but only one quest and others didn't have a new map but had a bit more quests.
-Operation: Anchorage was boring and annoying to play just so you have the cliche ending where the people you were there to help wanted to kill you while some were on your side.
-The Pitt basically made you choose between 2 evils and let you decide who is the lesser evil. I liked that they did this, but that the only good thing about it everything else was a sad excuse of a dlc. Would have regretted my purchase if i payed full price at release for this.
-Broken Steel was awesome. Loved that they continued the story and let you see the outcome of the decision you made in the main quest line. Had some nice side quests too so i'm glad i played this one.
-Point Lookout was trash. Main quest introduced an annoying rich asshole and his 'enemy'. Ended up killing both of them just because i was sick and tired of them. There were some nice side quests, one comes to mind is the evil book that you had to destroy.
-Mothership Zeta was trash just because all you had to do is run around the ship all game. The map system from this game doesn't help out when there are multiple layers (like floor 1, floor 2, etc.) and you had to hunt for that stair case most of the time.

The bugs and crashes were horrendous. I encountered everything from textures floating to random crashes in some places that made it impossible to continue.
Yeah i get it, the game is from 2008 it's normal to have some out of the place textures. But, and it's a big but, TES 4 Oblivion came out in 2006 and had less textures floating and random crashes.

The random crashes were so annoying to deal with. Literally did every fix possible and it was still not enough, let me enumerate them:
-tried using the unofficial path, but that wasn't any good because i got crashes still and some doors were forever locked (talking about the general shop in megaton)
-tried to put the game in compatibility mode with admin privileges, did nothing and still had crashes
-disabled steam overlay, did nothing and still had crashes
-disabled the auto saves on travel, wait and the third one i can't remember, did nothing and still had crashes

At this point i kept getting crashes, but pulled through and finished the game even tho i still got random crashes just starring at a wall or a floor. Had no mods installed so the crashes couldn't be caused from them.
For a game that has this many issues it baffles me that you can buy it even tho it's not working 100%.

As a conclusion i loved this game playing it for the first time back in the day and mostly enjoyed my time with it replaying it. I cannot recommend this because it's not working properly, even if you jump through hoops to find a fix for the game it will still crash out of the blue.

22370,"I remember sitting on an ottoman 5 feet from my tiny tv watching the Fallout 3 coverage at E3. The gameplay absolutely blew me away.

I didn’t have my own money or a modern console so there was a no chance I’d get it at launch.

However, a couple years later my friend told me at lunch that he purchased Fallout 3: GOTY Edition, but his computer wouldn’t play it. GameStop wouldn’t let him return it either. I immediately offered to trade him a PC copy of Oblivion I had, since he might be able to play that on his older pc. He accepted.

God only knows how many hours I played Fallout 3 at like 15fps because my computer sucked too.

After a couple years I got a job and bought a ps3 and another copy of Fallout 3 for that. I remember one of my files has 300+ hours on it.

All these years later I got a steam deck and decided to play through Fallout 3 once again. It still stands as one of my top favorite games ever made. It ran like crap on Windows 10, but crashes were so minimal on the Steam Deck, it is definitely the way to go.

Installing the Fellout mod to remove the green filter is a must have. I also like the essential companions and merchants mod. I added the zero degradation mod this time around so I wouldn’t spend half my time taping things together.

22380,"Freedom, in every sense of the word.

A great RPG that'll give you an awesome and immersive time and is worth picking up if you haven't played it, even if its a game that came out 12 years ago. Its unreal how many different ways you can play this game. You really can't experience everything FNV has to offer in one playthrough with how much content it has and the insane amount of options it gives you when it comes to LITERALLY everything. Your choices matter alot and you can clearly see the effects of your decisions through the world and the NPCs around you. That alone is enough of a reason to do multiple playthroughs for all the different paths you can take and feel the consequences of each one of them. The writing, the world design, the quest design and even the music, are all masterfully done. The combat is good enough, nothing special. 

However, FNV is not perfect. Far from it. Obsidian was given only 18 months to make the game. And, while impressive, was also a major detriment, as the final product turned out to be a janky, buggy mess that would crash constantly. Some of the issues could be fixed with console commands, but some you either just deal with it, or install performance mods (which I highly recommend doing tbh) to make it actually playable and not give you an aneurysm. And its really not a good look when I have to install mods just so I can play without crashing every hour or two. It didn't help that the game stopped getting patches not long after its release. But that's the only real problems I have with the game, mostly on the technical side. Almost everything else is near perfect. The visuals could've been better too I guess but I don't care that much about it. Caravan suck ass but you know, you might enjoy it.

The DLC's are worth playing through. Most are great, they're not all equal when it comes to quality. One in particular, while I did had some fun, I'll never redo again for.. reasons. If you know you know.

Overall, a wonderful game that will give you an experience unlike any other. I recommend getting it, even with the flaws I've pointed out above because the pros this game offers heavily outweigh the cons.

22450,"I first purchased this game for Xbox many years ago during college. It was a fun game to pick up and play when I felt bored with the rest of my collection but it never quite captured my attention or imagination at that time. As such it remained unbeaten and simply collected dust on the shelf.

Recently however, as I was sifting through the Bethesda Spring Sale event, I stumbled upon this game yet again. Ironically it was under the same circumstances as previously mentioned: I was bored with my current collection. I purchased the game for under $2, promptly downloaded it, adjusted the settings, and dove right in.

Hunted: The Demon's Forge is a fun, simple, and entertaining co-op third-person RPG (though it can be played in single-player) that really does leave me feeling satisfied in its simplicity. It's a game that doesn't take itself too seriously, though it still manages to maintain my attention while drawing me further into its world. The visuals are lovely (and dark), the gameplay itself is enjoyable (albeit limited in terms of movement/exploration/mechanics), inventory management is non-existent (which is freeing), and the skill tree is not overly complicated. In reality this game is about as straight-forward as you can imagine. While the movement can be limited and clunky at times, I don't find that this detracts from the overall quality of the gameplay. The only thing I really had to get used to was the general lack of a visceral feeling to the gameplay itself. Many modern games figure out ways to make the player feel like they're actually swinging the sword, or shooting the weapon, or landing on their feet after jumping from a platform. Feedback from these types of actions can be given by way of carefully-curated sound effects, visuals, etc. Hunted: The Demon's Forge lacked this feeling in that the gameplay felt light, airy, and disconnected. Another game that I happen to love that also feels this way is Unreal II: The Awakening. I never quite felt like I was trudging through a fetid swamp or hacking my way through a cold, dark, damp dungeon, all the while swinging my axe or slamming arrows into the heads of my enemies. My movements and actions always felt disjointed, almost like playing an arcade game where you can truly feel the distance between you and the character you're playing.

All-in-all though, this game is really fun and entertaining. It's unfortunate it slipped under so many people's radars and, as a consequence, fell by the wayside because it has a lot of raw, straight-forwarding hacking & slashing to offer. In a way this game offers a similar experience to the first two Mummy movies. It's not ground-breaking, it's not immense, it's not complex or too serious: it's just fun and entertaining. Oh...and it's dirt cheap :)",True,3
22450,"Hunted: The Demon's Forge is an action-adventure game developed by inXile Entertainment. The game features a unique blend of third-person shooter and hack-and-slash gameplay, set in a dark and gritty fantasy world.

Players take on the roles of two mercenaries, Caddoc and E'lara, who are tasked with exploring ancient ruins and battling hordes of demons and other supernatural creatures. The game's combat system is fast-paced and satisfying, with players able to switch between ranged and melee attacks on the fly.

One of the standout features of Hunted: The Demon's Forge is its co-op gameplay, with players able to team up with a friend to tackle the game's challenges together. The game also features a variety of puzzles and exploration elements that help to break up the action and keep things interesting.

Overall, Hunted: The Demon's Forge is a solid action-adventure game that offers a unique blend of gameplay styles and an engaging world to explore. While it may not be the most innovative game in its genre, it's definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of fantasy-themed action games or looking for a co-op experience.",True,2

You can go anywhere you want but don't expect to survive long. Your best bet is to keep to the roads and follow them to the nearest settlements, at least for your first time. Once you get to grips with the game you will be finding your own ways around the mohave desert. The strongest parts of the game are the factions, the intriguing plot and some of the funniest dialogues and quest you will find in RPGs. It is truly a gem and no one playthrough will be the same.

[/b]It is a small unique deckbuilding cardbattler with potentially unlimited replayability. I played it as a flash game more than a decade ago and was immediately hooked. While it has a campaign where you gain cards based on your actions, normal game mode does not have the collectible aspect of say, Magic: The Gathering. You can form a deck with any cards from the available classes, with each playable deck comprising of 20 cards: four cards each from four elemental types (fire, water, air and earth) and four from your special class. Elemental decks have 12 cards each, of increasing value, from which you have to select four, while special class decks have eight cards each. You normally gain one mana of each type every turn, so you have to choose carefully what cards you have in the deck and can use at a certain point. Once you have mastered all 16 types of special classes of the full game, you can just select random (and random) for your deck (and your opponent's, if you are playing singleplayer) to see if you can win with any deck, providing unlimited gameplay value. I am not much of a multiplayer guy, but I noticed people still playing it after about 15 years of release. Also, I was surprised to find out how intelligent and efficient the enemy AI is in the game, which is a rare thing in many high budget games. I remember playing against highest difficulty oppoent with little issue in the flash game, but in the PC version, even the medium difficulty opponents are quite challenging. I had the game on my wishlist ever since I joined Steam, but didn't buy it before as I read on the forums about annoying third-party DRM, which the devs removed recently.

Not sure how to fix and not sure I care. 

A slight upgrade from the first game. Enemy AI is basically the same, but the game itself is harder.

22650,"[h1]For more reviews and gameplay videos by Morgoth, check out the profile or the Twitch channel at twitch.tv/morgoth0221[/h1]

My review for the original Alien Breed: Impact can be seen on it's store page, and seeing how this game is nearly identical, I'm not going to go into full detail.  While I did recommend Impact, I simply cannot recommend Assault.  The only thing this game does better is the graphics.  That is it.  Even in that department, a lot (and I mean a lot) of the rooms and floors were identical to the original game!  That's just lazyness.  This was by far, much more mind-numbing than the original as there didn't really seem to be much plot at all.  Around 90% of this game was just wondering around from one objective to another with no clear idea of what each objective did to actually affect the plot.  It's like this game was literally just filler.  There was some plot exposure near the end of the game to explain what exactly is going on, but it was all bundled into one single cutscene.  Why were there four other levels?  They serve no purpose.  Maybe it's just me, but whenever a game sets an objective for your character and you fight through countless (generic) enemies to reach said objective, I feel like something should have been accomplished besides just setting another objective.  The storytelling is pretty dull.

There are a few more changes from the original however.  A few new enemies were introduced (one I believe, and it is just incredibly annoying).  They changed out two of the weapons from the original (laser rifle and ion thingy), for the hyper blaster (really good for mowing down tons of enemies), and the almost completely useless rocket launcher.  Yes, this weapon does tremendous amounts of damage to all in the blast range....including you.  Now, that does make sense in any game that a weapon as powerful as a rocket launcher is a double-edged sword, but in retrospect, in other games you can aim the damn thing.  In Assault, you can only choose the direction.  That means if the smallest little alien makes his way somehow right in front of you at the last second before you're about to fire a damn missile, it will explode point blank....killing you instantly.  Not even close to being worth it, as some save points can be up to ten to 15 minutes behind you.

Other than that, there are three (kind of) new boss fights in this one with one of the fights taking place very near the beginning, which was refreshing.  And honestly, it was the only slightly interesting one.  The second boss fight which takes place near the end of the game was so dull, I wasn't really sure it was a boss fight.  It's only attack seemed to be throwing a ton of little enemies at you at once.   .....and that's it.  FYI, don't use the rocket launcher on him as you will most likely kill yourself.  And finally, the last boss fight which was actually just a bunch of enemies all at once, was unbelievably underwhelming.  Saw the giant turret you sit in, got excited, was blown away about how dull it was to fire that turret.  Put some damn impact in those shells!  Make it fun!  Make it exciting!  Just not this.  I might as well have been firing the pistol as it felt the same.

Overall, I do not recommend this game in the series at all unless you're up for wasting 5 hours.  If you really want to play the trilogy, play the first, read about the plot in the second, and go play the third.  Right now, I'm two missions into the third and I have to say it looks like the best of the three by far.  As for this one....just don't.",False,16

If you want to mow things down with no ethical quandry, this is a good game series. I had fun all the way through. It doesn't do anything unique or ground breaking, but it's solid for what it is. The game has a good number of weapons, each good in different situations. Flame thrower is fun.

I think one of my few complaints about this game series is a minor preference thing. There's 3 different upgrades for each weapon but you can only choose ONE. If you upgrade to another you will only be using the new one, not both. Just a money saving tip.",True,12
22650,"NEGATIVE REVIEW, not recommending.

I can safely say that this review will match my review of the first game word for word. Around 8 hours of tedious, repetitive gameplay. I read many reviews about how all three Alien Breed games are basically the same game, and upon completing the second game, I have to admit, they're right about what they said. 

This game has no real improvement over the first one, with the exception of a few small things. The plot is not very memorable, as per the first game. All I remember is that we're fixing YET ANOTHER ship, and there were some areas of it that I could recognize distinctly being in the first game--they're reusing maps. It exposes way too much of the environment with this tactic.

It's always ""go to this objective, kill aliens, fix it, kill aliens, go back to where you first started off, kill more aliens, rinse and repeat"". They tried to revive the classic Alien Breed, but this developer isn't doing so well nowadays. If you're a fan of monotonous works, it's for you. Otherwise, steer clear of it. 

The two things that I found nice that they did change was the boss and the actual real antagonist. There is a more interesting boss battle halfway into the game; however, the way they go about it made it seem petty the third time you had to kill the SAME BOSS that just got crushed within a train. It's just not logical. But the fight was more interesting.

And then the antagonist. In the first Alien Breed game, there didn't feel like there was any main antagonist to fight; the only thing you could call your enemy was the aliens that were constantly attacking you. Near the end of the game, they FINALLY decided to bring up a being that you could call your antagonist of the story. I love whoever voice acted him--it's very pleasant to hear in a world of monotonous voices that you'll never be able to recall. However, the comics between chapters aren't telling me enough about this character, and I'm wondering why this antagonist is even trying to stop Conrad from destroying the ship. There's too many plot holes to be able to fully enjoy this mysterious antagonist. 

Also, the ending was complete bull. It was disappointing and did NOT leave me wanting to know more, because of how dull and anti-climactic it was in the end. 

I'll be honest, I did TRY to enjoy it, thinking that it was just my preference of games that made this so unappealing to me to play, but after reading tens of reviews about the lackluster gameplay, I feel that I can stand by my review.",False,10
22650,I don't understand the positive reviews. Alien Breed 2 could have been decent if done right but it has the same flaws as its predecessor: 1. screen-shaking effects after every explosion which happens every 3-6s. 2. navigating the menu is still annoying with all these effects.

the presentation is fine, but resolution options are the annoying 'left/right one by one' variety instead of a simple pull-down list and the game doesn't recognize your native resolution on first startup. alt+tab also goes through resolution changes. there are separate volume settings for the grating music and the okay sfx, plus a few languages and in-game representation of achievements. since there's a girl announcing combos and the like (quite a contrast to bejeweled's deep voice), a separate speech slider would've been necessary, along with a 'static butterflies' toggle and the settings to be available while playing.

23300,"Another variant on the block puzzler genre, Yosumin! sees you play on a 9x9 grid of blocks where you have to click on four blocks of the same shape/colour to describe the corners of a square or rectangle, which transforms all blocks within that space into the same colour as the selected corner blocks before removing all those blocks then replacing them with another mix of blocks. BLOCKS!

Each stage sets you objectives, ranging from the simplistic, like removing a quota of specific coloured blocks, to the more challenging, such as clearing an entire board with one move (this move being where the game gets its name, in the same way Tetris is the name given to clearing the maximum of four lines in a single drop), with each stage being cleared by completing all of these objectives.

The whole things starts off at a very basic, and even mundane degree of difficulty as you breeze through the majority of the opening stages in the space of a couple of minutes, but by the final quarter or so of the game this is turned on its head as the ever strangling time limit can soon grind you down unless you have very sharp eyes or a lot of luck finding the right blocks to match. This deceptively high difficulty spike of the final stages seems very at odds with the über casual, child-friendly presentation of every aspect of the title and may see many quit before reaching the end, even with the extra added help of bonus unlocks which act as perks to aid in varying elements of play.

But even if you do quit by then, ultimately you're not really going to miss out on all that much. The opening few hours play much the same as the final hours save for some minor added elements and complications added to proceedings that actually change things very little of the game beyond its initial premise.

The game is incredibly repetitive, there's about 5 'levels' each one has 7 or 8 zones and each level follows the same pattern to those zones.  Collect X amount of coloured blocks in zone 1, make 4 squares in zone 2, collect X amount of stained glass peices, etc.....  It's pretty well the same each level, except another colour is introduced.

You are also given different powers to help each level, but those powers are very weak and don't see to improve much on what they say they are suppose to improve (not to a noticable level anyways).  

There are things that pop up in the puzzle to make it more difficult.  Theres a character that shuffles all the blocks (actually surprisingly helpful instead of a problem).  As well there can be bigger blocks of various sizes that can be difficult to remove.

Again this game is incredibly simple.  However if thats the type of puzzle game your looking for, you may want to give this a try.",False,5

23300,"I bought Yosumin because I was looking for a new puzzle game in the same vein as all those Match-3 games. (That is, you've got a screen full of gems or ice-cream or whatever and you have to line up three in a row of the same colour to get them to disappear). The reason I settled on this one was because it's made by Square-Enix, famous for Final Fantasy and other great RPGs and I was wondering what their take on a puzzle game would be.

Turns out, not really any different than anyone else's puzzle games. In Yosumin, instead of trying to match 3 of the same, you have to match 4, but not in a row, they just have to form the corners of a rectangle. Yes, it's a game about forming rectangles. Sounds boring as hell, but it works alright, mostly. Each level you're given different goals like make 4 small rectangles, or 2 of each colour, or whatever, so there's a bit of variety. 

There are a couple of gameplay mechanics that I think just don't work in this game's favour. One is that as you progress through the game you unlock more coloured blocks, so there are less and less possibly rectangles to form. I get that games have to get harder as you go along, but you'll feel less like you're solving puzzles then being at the mercy of whatever random blocks fall your way. Many times there'll be just the one rectangle possible and you'll be scrambling to find it until the game gives up and gives you a hint. The reason you'll be scrambling is the second problem, each level is timed, and if you don't make it in time, it's game over. Not only that, but as your timer runs low, they give you that panic-inducing sped up music to really help stress you out.

So I found that the further into the game I got, the less fun I was having. Maybe I'm just biased against puzzle games with a timer. I don't like having to think fast. I kept playing anyway for quite a while just because as you play you unlock pieces of a stained glass window and I really wanted to complete it. But in the end it wasn't enough to combat the stress it was causing me.

So I don't recommend this game. It's not the worst puzzle game, but it's not particularly clever or unique either, and those flaws I mentioned are enough of a turn off. 2/5 stars. Buy it only if you're a super fan of rectangles.",False,4
23300,"Good game for puzzle game lovers. It has the same basic concept as most other puzzle games (making matches), but it's got a unique take on match-making. You have to find rectangular patterns on the game board. It's not a game that you'll blow through in an hour, so it's worth it at its regular price. The music is peppy and upbeat, and I haven't gotten sick of it, so that says something good. The graphics are bright and cheerful, and the little faces on each of the pieces are adorable. 

New obstacles and game pieces show up at a decent pace. There's enough variety in objectives for each level (like matching a certain amount of certain colored pieces, making square matches, making small, standard, or large sets), but the objectives repeat a bit too much and start to feel samey. While this game isn't on the same level as Clash of Heroes and Critter Crunch, it's still a fun, lighthearted puzzle game that's worth your time.",True,4

23380,"This is one of those ones where you want to give it both a thumbs up and a thumbs down. The actual game play is good, marred only by a sudden difficulty spike a third of the way through the game. The story - especially the writing - is awful.

The game is a collaboration between Square Enix and Popcap who seem to have both seen the cross-over hit Puzzlequest and decided they wanted a piece of the action. The core game is Bejewelled Twist with some extra running around mazes. You have different beasts to use in the matches and the affect how often special gems appear and what abilities they trigger. It does keep you on your toes strategy-wise. The main criticism of the game-play is that the rules suddenly change after four levels in a rather significant way. It does not make it easier. To be fair, without the change the game would get stale before the end, but its introduction is done poorly.

The packaging around the game-play is pitiful. The story is nonsense and the writing is terrible. I'm pretty sure the good guys were spending most of the time trying to suppress a popular uprising so the ruling classes could maintain their privilege. On top of this the art work (all static) looks like a cheap knock-off of the art from old dungeons and dragons books. The hero and heroine are eternally stuck in dramatic poses without any context.

I should add that the graphics are stuck at 720p. This was standard for Popcap games of the era, they didn't target people with the latest gaming rigs. What graphics options there are can be turned up to the maximum on any computer of the past decade (possibly two). Since most people will have been playing at at least 1080p it will be noticeable, but you get used to it.

Europa Universalis: Rome is a game I like very much at the moment, I have not played any other Europa Universalis games and some of them might be better (after I bought the game I heard from people that 3 is better) I however do not regret my purchase since I like the ancient world theme a lot more than almost anything else set in the real world and is for me a tie with the cold war.

Why did I like this game?

I think It is mechanically very sound, the combat mechanics are very limited but unlike for example civ 4 I do not find it annoying to fight wars and the combat does not distract too much from what works really well with the game.
    So what does work really well in the game?  The economic gameplay in the game is solid, it is less about buildings than for example Rome total war 1, however there are various other things that have an influence on the economy such the governors of the province that you can select (very much like Rome total war 1) but also stuff like the people you have chosen to take positions in nationwide politics, the laws you have passed, religious blessings, trade and the kind of civ you have( for example dictatorship monarchy and various kinds of democracies). 
    That brings me to something else that works pretty well in this game, Politics. The game has 5 political factions that battle (sometimes in case of civil war literally) over political control of your nation. Each factions power can grow or diminish depending on your actions, the populist party will for example gain more political attraction if either peace or war last too long, while the religious faction can grow from invoking blessings on your nation or sacrificing to the gods, but all factions grow from having representatives in important functions for (for example the research positions) the people taking these functions are chosen by you. But on the other side the factions can also influence your decisions, if you don't have the political support in the senate you can't start wars or make use of various other mechanics in the diplomacy interface.

What doesn't work?

The game doesn't do such a good job of explaining to you what various mechanics in the game do and how they are calculated (I for example still don't know fully how diplomatic skill is calculated) most of it however isn't that annoying and can in a way even increase your enjoyment, since you get the feeling that after your first playthrough you really got to know the game, therefore also giving you an incentive to try another one. It also isn't that bad, now after some wiki reading I think diplomatic skill is the only thing I do not really understand that I would like to understand. The game could however do a better job of presenting its information, the game could for example tell you what the traits characters could gain during events do before you need to selects them. Also I think the game could have been better if the people of your nation belonged to larger but fewer families and give you a better way (for example the family tree in Rome total war 1) to look at these families and their relations to other people in your nation

In the end I sill liked this game very much but it could have been better",True,169
23420,"First of all, I'd like to say that I'm an experienced but not expert player of the Paradox Games.

I saw EU: Rome on Steam and, basically, bought it to give it a try.

CONS
1) For a 2008 Game, Graphics should've been better.
2) Not the variety of factions that HoI3 or EUIV have.
3) Steam version forces you to search for the manual here. Also, the tutorial could've been better.
4) Surely, not as worth as EUIV but I'd love to try something until HoI4 goes public.
5) There are no mods is Steam for this game. Maybe the CD version (regular installation) supports them, but I couldn't find anything here.

PROS
1) Cheap. 10 euros for a Grand Strategy Game by Paradox. It's God's will!
2) The ""Vae Victis"" expansion and all patches are included.
3) Historical accuracy and interesting gameplay. It starts with the Invasion of Pyrrhus in Italy and the wars between Romans and Greeks.
4) Variety of historical starts. From an early Roman Republic to the Civil Wars and the foundation of the Roman Empire. Yeah!
5) Awesome music. That may sound stupid, but have a look at YouTube... Yeah, you're welcome.
6) Don't know if it's the way the AI works, but a huge advantage of the game is that factions like Rome, Carthage, Seleucids, Egypt, Macedon and Pontus actually grow up. So, a player gets to experience the ""anxiety"" of fighting Rome in Magna Graecia or Carthage in Africa. If you're a TWR2 player, you'll see a huge difference. Factions like the Illyrians don't consume Empires in no time, like in Rome 2. You hear that CA?

23420,"Europa Universalis Rome is Paradox's attempt at creating a game to bridge the gameplay gap between the great but somewhat generic grand strategy of Europa Universalis and the personal management and dynastic aspects of Crusader Kings. Unfortunately this is not a marriage made in heaven and the two styles does not mix well in this game.

Rome is a grand strategy game, you pick your nation among those that were around at whatever start date you chose and then go about doing what ever you please. War, trade, diplomacy, like in other Paradox grand strategy games you can play your country however you please but the game is still geared heavily in the favor of warfare. You will simply gain more and gain it faster by taking it from others.

Introduced in this game is a myriad of characters that rule your cities and lead your armies all with their own traits, preferences and family relations. Unlike in Crusader Kings you don't have your own family tree in this game but instead simply try to manage your various powerful subjects in this manner. Although this is a great idea in principle it is fairly poorly executed. Managing the many, many characters available to you is a huge task that only grows larger as the game goes on and if you chose to ignore the micromanagement for too long you might have a revolt on your hands.

Rome is a game that brings a lot of cool aspects together from two very great game but it is also a game that has a lot of issues with implementation and execution that makes it a chore to play at times.

1 Have a clean install of the game

3 patch to 2.36b in the rome folder
4 install the mod in the mod folder
5 change the name of the cache folder (in map folder) to cache_vanilla
6 create a new folder named cache in map folder and then stick inside the previous province_texture that you have copy in the desktop

But unlike in EU3 and EU4, you can't have cabinet members that give your country bonuses ( trade does that, but it's not as interesting). But I do like this more than the other games because:

 1. It's a longer game than EU3. I don't know about EU4 because I haven't ever played it.

3. Altough this game looses some features, it also gains ones. For example, the troops in your army can become more loyal to their general than their country.

I don't think it's going to replace some of the great point-and-click classics, but it's a nice little game in its own right and is worth a look.

It features nice 3D graphics (especially for its time), very good voice acting (eveything is voiced), quite humorous, and a good story.  There are three playable characters: Ceville (the sniveling deposed ruler), Ambrosious the (hilariously) pompous knight, and Lilly (a cute little girl who has great banter with Ceville).  Sometimes you play multiple characters simultaneously, and there are points where you have to do one thing as one character, switch to another, and complete a task.

Note that there are a few clearly-identifiable timed elements (a clock will tick) where you have to do something within, say, 10 seconds.  There are no failures that require a re-load, and you can save any time.  You can double-click to skip run animations, and you can hold the spacebar to reveal hidden objects.

Most of the puzzles are quite fair and reasonable-- there were a few I had to get help with...which IMO is a good thing.  Many of the puzzles are combining inventory items in a (usually) intuitive way...and using dialog trees to open up new paths.

The puzzle design is unintuitive even for someone, who sat through notorious 90's adventure games. It's not hard by any means, but so absurdly arbitrary, that you'll be thrown out of flow every 10 or so actions. 

All in all, it's deeply dissatisfying and one of the worst point'n'click adventure experiences I ever had.
